"dbpedia ontology version 3.9"	"uHello, I'm a bit puzzled about the current version of the dbpedia ontology. The owl Version of the ontology ( More puzzling is the fact that dbpedia_3.9.owl does not contain all of the classes listed at I found however a third file at In summary there are three different versions of dbpedia.owl which all carry the versionInfo tag 3.8 and only one of them is coherent with the listing at Best regards Johannes Ce message et ses pieces jointes peuvent contenir des informations confidentielles ou privilegiees et ne doivent donc pas etre diffuses, exploites ou copies sans autorisation.

The subclasses mentioned were not on the mapping wiki when 3.9 was released. The mapping wiki always shows the current status of DBpedia (since it is evolving over time), which can also be found on DBpedia live. The DBpedia dumps are snapshots of a certain point in time of the mappings wiki and Wikipedia (dumps). Thus the difference. Nothing to worry about.

"Complete set of DBpedia resources?"	"uHi all, Luis says: Luis, instance types are extracted from mappings that were handcrafted at This means that if a page does not have an infobox, it will not have a type statement. You can get a list of all DBpedia resources that DBpedia Spotlight cares about by running our indexing code and grabbing the \"Concept URIs\" file. As an alternative, you could just \"bzcat | cut | sort | uniq\" the union of DBpedia download files. But, folks, I think that Luis has a point. On the one hand, by definition, everything is an owl:Thing, so even if we do not include this statement explicitly, any reasoner should be able to infer that. On the other hand, we do not assume that people are using reasoners, so I wonder what is the right thing to do here. A few options that I considered: 1) add documentation explaining that clients should infer \"rdf:type owl:Thing\" for every resource mentioned anywhere in DBpedia 2) provide a new dataset \"obvious_instance_types_en.nt\" with statements like \"?resource rdf:type owl:Thing\" for every DBpedia Resource that we include in our dumps 3) include \"?resource rdf:type owl:Thing\" in instance_types for every resource that does not have another type there Is there another easy way to grab the set of all resources in DBpedia? Cheers, Pablo Hi all, Luis says: First I assumed that the infobox types (instance_types_en.nt.bz2) contains all the tags which spotlight is able to extract from a text.

"Importing Wikipedia"	"uHi all, for those of you who want to run the DBpedia extraction locally, here are some tips on how to import a Wikipedia dump: 1. configure your mysql server! thats very very important. if you have enough RAM, use it. Find my mysql config below. 2. have two hard-disks. one for the mysql data, one for the wikipedia dumps. 3. use a standalone machine. the Wikipedia import puts a lot of load on harddisk and cpu. I used to use one of our application servers, which already had some load on it, and the import took weeks. 4. defrag your harddisks. can save some time. 5. configure the dbpedia import script. if your're not running a server OS, remove the \"-server\" flag in the java mwdumper call. (ok, this is not a performance tip, just a note for getting it working) On my workstation (intel quadcore 2,66 ghz, 8gb ram, vista 64bit, two 10k harddisks), the Wikipedia import took around a very decent 6 hours. Cheers, Georgi mysql config: key_buffer = 1024M max_allowed_packet = 32M table_cache = 256 sort_buffer_size = 512M net_buffer_length = 8M read_buffer_size = 64M read_rnd_buffer_size = 64M myisam_sort_buffer_size = 512M"

"DBpedia RDF filenames"	"uHi All, Am writing, with a niggling issue with the dbpedia3.5.1 tar ball. I have downloaded and parsed the whole lot using libraptor, and yay it all seems to parse correctly, but I wonder why all of the file names are .nt ? For the ntriples serialisation of RDF is said to be in \"ascii\", and most of the .nt files in the tar ball are not legal ascii, and hence not legal ntriples. Saying that I managed to parse all of the files using a turtle paser, turtle allows for unicode characters to be used. This could be slightly confusing to someone coming to use the dbpedia tar ball for the first time, perhaps all of the file extensions should be .ttl which seems to be the standard file extension for turtle files.

Owen notes in the article that at the time of its writing, he had known Meyer for nearly 25 years, when they were both students and members of the ''Harvard Lampoon'' writing staff. (en) My first question is where is this coming from? Is this from an older wikipedia page? I could not readily see that in the history tab in wikipedia. Is there a way to map versions between dbpedia and wikipedia? Also in dbpedia we see another different influences uri: with the following objects: * dbpedia:Harvard_Lampoon * dbpedia:Mad_%28magazine%29 * dbpedia:The_New_Yorker Where are these in wikipedia and how do the two influences properties relate? The last question is that I can find entries in dbpedia with only two URI's in a row: for example: but no objectif you go to wikipedia, there is no object either. So this is a triple that is not really a triple? I know the conversion is not trivial, I just want to understand what to make of this and what semantics I can expect to find in dbpedia so any comments would be very appreciated. Thanks much! Marvin"

"DBpedia in 2011 - Opening up to the community"	"uDear all, DBpedia has become quite a famous project, but there is one thing that is still missing. The Time's Person of the Year 2006: *You* DBpedia has limitless use cases and possibilities for extension: - more languages, more wikis (Wikibooks, Wiktionary), more ontologies, more & better data ! In the last years, it was always my impression that the DBpedia team, although we really worked hard and tried our best, limited, in a way, the advance and improvement of the project. So now in 2011 we will of course continue doing, what we are already doing, but in addition we will hand over some possibilities and access to the DBpedia Community. Some things that already happened: - There is a Wiki for editing the mappings: - You can register at the main DBpedia page update pages such as - A DBpedia Internationalization Committee was founded: Now we will soon go one step further: 1. A new mailing list has been created[1] called dbpedia-developers (it is public now). It is for those of you that really want to or ALREADY work on the scala framework to discuss code and other things. This will go along with the addition of more developers from the community to the Sourceforge project. For this reason we will switch to Mercurial [2] soon (around January 17th) and then give access to new developers. Mercurial is a distributed system and it is much easier to handle branches. Developers can test new extractors and new features in a branch and once it is stable we will merge it into the trunk. 2. We integrated Stack and Semantic Overflow on the site to help people get help: A lot of community members were using it already. 3. There are two more pages I'd like to mention: Committee: 4. There is a mailing list for the Wiktionary conversion; the dump will come out some time this year, I guess: The question we still have is: What other infrastructure shall we - the maintainers - provide for the community, so the project can blossom: Now we have 2 Wikis, 2 Mailing lists, 2 StackOverflows and soon 1 Mercurial Repository the community can access Anything else?

There were even worse cases. e.g. Braniff_(Disambiguation) was made to Braniff, which was a redirect to Braniff_International_Airways There is no correct algortihmic approach to solve this matter, so the reason, why we changed it, is that it reflects the pages on Wikipedia as they are, without any transformations, that might lead to a strange representation. If Apple is a FloweringPlant, how can it disambiguate Apple Inc.? The concepts have nothing to with each other, except sharing the String identifier.

It's quite a big change to have made (the disambiguation dataset has nearly doubled in size between 3.3 and 3.4) - was there any discussion on the mailing list as to the best implementation (for example, it might be nice to add a reference to the disambiguation page - 'disambiguated by' or similar) ? Is there any benefit in setting up a dbpedia-developers list, in order to discuss these changes to the core data ? Rob uRob Lee schrieb: The disambiguation issue was considered a bug and therefore just fixed. Especially, with the upcoming live extraction, DBpedia clearly needs to reflect Wikipedia on a page level. A dbpedia-developers list is something, which is on our todo list, but it should not be another mailing list. Currently, our developers are busy. One thing is the live extraction, the other thing is the complete refactoring of the extraction framework in java/scala. Code fluctuation is so high, that a developers list would be not effective. However, I understand the concern, you have. There should be more public influence and we are working on that. Part of it comes bundled with the live extraction and also, once we have a steady code base, there should be appropriate places to discuss changes and enhancements properly. Also the vocabulary used should reflect consensus. As a preview, you can have a look here: Regards, Sebastian uSebastian Hellmann wrote: Hmm, I'm not sure I agree on that, I don't think live extraction should be driving the way data is represented in dbpedia. Live extraction should be a technological solution to a problem, not impact the data model ? I'd also question the fact that a 'bug' can just be 'fixed' without any assessment or notification. When fixing a bug, you typically look at the impact of the change to fix it, in this case the impact is large as it drastically changes the model behind how disambiguations work (in fact I 'd even question classifying it as a bug - there was a clear design intent behind how it used to work, which someone in the dbpedia team disagreed with and decided to change, rather than there being an error in the code/implementation). I'm guessing the way it used to work was designed/decided as a result of this feature request/email : the 3.4 release in the bug tracker (I searched for disambiguation). Is this being used by the current development team, is it worth people raising bugs there anymore ? Also, I'm still a little confused by the disambiguation issue, looking at It still appears to have' disambiguates' properties ? I don't know the reasons behind the rewrite (has there been any discussion about it or if it's needed ?) but I always refer people to is touted. I think thats an argument you could level at any open source project at one time or another but other projects do manage to have them, in fact when code fluctuation is high, thats a very good time to have one so that people discuss changes > However, I understand the concern, you have. There should be more public Thanks, I will have a look. Is it mentioned on the main dbpedia site anywhere? I don't recall seeing it before."
"Help with Dbpedia Extraction Framework"	"uHey everyone, Im trying to setup the Dbpedia extraction framework as Im interested in getting structured data from already downloaded wikipedia dumps. As per my understanding I need to work in the dump directory of the codebase. I have tried to reverse engineer ( given scala is new for me) but I need some help. 1. First of all, is there a more detailed documentation somewhere about setting and running the pipeline. The one available on dbpedia.org seems insufficient. 2. I understand that I need to create a config.properties file first where I need to setup input/output locations, list of extractors and the languages. I tried working with the config.properties.default given in the code. There seems to be some typo in the extractor list. org.dbpedia.extraction.mappings.InterLanguageLinksExtractorExtractor using this gives class not found error. I converted it to org.dbpedia.extraction.mappings.InterLanguageLinksExtractor. Is it ok ? 3. I cant find the documentation on how to setup the input directory. Can someone tell me the details? From what I gather, input directory should contain a commons directory plus, directory for all languages set in config.properties. All these directories must have a subdirectory whose name should be of YYYYMMDD format. Within that you save the xml files such as enwiki-20111111-pages-articles.xml. Am I right ? Does the framework work on any particular dump of Wikipedia? Also what goes in the commons branch ? 4. I ran the framework by copying a sample dump Sorry if the question are too basic and already mentioned somewhere. I have tried looking but couldnt find myself. Also another question: Is there a reason for the delay in subsequent Dbpedia releases ? I was wondering , if the code is already there, why does it take 6 months between Dbpedia releases?

As far as I can tell, you're right. But there is no particular dump. You just need to follow the convention for the directory structure. The commons directory has a similar structure, see: wikipediaDump/commons/20110729/commonswiki-20110729-pages-articles.xml I think this file is only used by the image extractor and maybe a couple of others. Maybe it should be only mandatory if the corresponding extractors are included in the config. But it's likely nobody got around to implementing that catch yet. 4) It seems the AbstractExtractor requires an instance of Mediawiki running The abstract extractor is used to render inline templates, as many articles start with automatically generated content from templates.

The DBpedia parser that parses the MediaWiki markup is not great at parsing tables. The reason is that the focus previously was on extracting information from infoboxes. The MappingExtractor class is the only one that attempts to use table mappings. If there are mis-parsed table structures, this could lead to infinite loops. All three pages that you mentioned contain tables. There might be syntactical constructions that the parser can't cope with at the moment.

Specifically the fact that your property URI ends with a closing bracket is a problem. It's a known issue that there are valid RDF graphs that can not be represented in RDF/XML (which is one of many good reasons not to use the RDF/XML syntax format). The extracted data is invalid XML, yes: an XML element QName can not contain brackets. Unfortunately, there is no right way to do this in your case. The RDF/XML spec recommends that a writer tries to split the URIref after the last non-NCName character and use an ad-hoc namespace declaration, but if the last character of the URIref is a non-NCName char (such as the closing bracket in your property URI), there is no way to split it, and a writer tool should report an error (apparently Virtuoso has opted for not giving an error but producing invalid XML instead - either way the communication breaks down). The only reliable way around the problem is to use a serialization format that does cope with all legal RDF properly, such as N-Triples or Turtle. Cheers, Jeen"

Other examples are many URLs that do not start with between \"<\" and \">\" such as in < I wonder what is the best way to solve this problem. I was optimistic at the beginning and started doing 'replace all' to correct some of the URIs but then it turns out that the problem can not really be reduced to a bunch of patterns easily. for example, there are 'links' to webpages which do not even start with 'www' but they are clearly a URL (e.g. < ayat-algormezi.blogspot.com>).

I don't have any - replace_it_all solution, but you should file a bug for DBpedia extractor demanding to check if the extracted URIs are valid and not passing them to the output, if they are not. Regarding a short-cut solution to your problem - I would pass the invalid input data via a script in Python or Ruby and leave only these entries which have valid URIs. Cheers, Aleksander uThanks Alexander I think it would really be great if there would be an additional step to the 'extraction' framework which would basically remove invalid triples.

"People in dbpedia"	"uHi, I've been looking at the people in dbpedia and have some questions about how resources are/aren't assigned particular types, and how data is generated for the data dumps & for the dbpedia live instance. I've highlighted the questions separate from my investigations. While there are a lot of different sub-classes for \"person\", there seem to be three primary classes used to describe people: * foaf:Person * dbpedia-owl:Person * yago:Person100007846 Firstly, I can see that dbpedia-owl:Person is defined to be an equivalent class to foaf:Person so I had naively expected every foaf:Person to also be a dbpedia-owl:Person. But this doesn't seem to be the case. For example: In both cases, these resources have types of yago:Person100007846 & foaf:Person but not dbpedia-owl:Person. Q1: how can someone people a foaf:Person but not a dbpedia-owl:Person? Secondly, there are people who have only the type yago:Person100007846: Q2: how can someone be a yago:Person100007846 but not have the other two types? Trying to dig a little deeper I looked at the wikipedia page for Claus Sluter. It appears that the page uses the Persondata template, which includes a date of death: I compared that to another artist, Louis Royer which also uses the Persondata template: That resource *is* defined as a foaf:Person. So I'm confused why both of these resources don't have a type of foaf:Person. The only difference I can see is that there's also a birthdate for that person. Q3: is the mapping to specific types sensitive to data in the templates? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Several times recently I've struggled to reliably query for people in dbpedia and it'd be great to get some of the inconsistencies identified/explained.

However as i am new to this field i request your advice on how it can be done. Till now i have been successful in linking the good quality (more than one assertion) concepts from concpetnet with cwcc classes and yago classes. ( the concepts are linked with categories as all member of the categories can be considered as related to the concept) The data is available from here aubhat2.googlepages.com Before linking the concepts with wikipedia articles (as done in cyc dataset) i would like to get your opinions regarding the similarity metrics which can be used. uHi Akshay, The description of Conceptnet on the project page sounds like this ontology could be very useful within many projects and it would be great to have it on the Semantic Web! Frederick and Mike (cc'ed) are currently doing similar work with interlinking their UMBEL ontology Yago. I guess they would be the right people to talk to about similarity metrics. For information about publishing your data, you could have a look at Keep on the good work! Cheers Chris uHi Akshay, Chris Bizer wrote: We, too, looked closely at ConceptNet and were quite intrigued. To my knowledge, the system is not being as actively maintained as previously, and that was a concern to us. But, that was only one factor among many that caused us to select OpenCyc as our reference concept basis. [1] We welcome you to follow the UMBEL project via its Google group [2] and to look for the coming documentation of how we explicitly vetted and mapped from OpenCyc. That documentation in three-volumes, due out hopefully by the end of this month, may provide some ideas for how you might tackle a ConceptNet mapping. I would guess there is a full person-year of efforts in our UMBEL stuff to date, so don't be surprised if your own effort is quite a bit to chew! As for similarity metrics, Chris has commented elsewhere on this and we have some new UMBEL predicates that deal with similar but non-equivalent class-class alignments (isAligned), entity-class (isAbout) and entity-entity (isLike) with associated predicates for inverse properties and similarity metrics. (The UMBEL ontology documentation and reference files will also be released at the same time as the OpenCyc vetting volumes.) Applying any of these predicates may be pretty tricky. The use of similarity metrics (\"confidence intervals\" if you will), especially, is a new area, and as I have written elsewhere, possibly as likely as nuclear waste to be widely embraced. :). In the interim, you may want to look at the Dec 2007 Yago technical report [3] and its Web site [4] for one approach. You may also want to look at some of the recent SKOS discussion on these issues of similarity alignments.[5] Good luck! Thanks, Mike [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Mapping section at end"

"Use of Fallback Languages for Query Results"	"uHi! I'm trying to build localization into a DBpedia application, but I've got a problem. I'm trying to use multilingual results from DBpedia in the follow way: - If available, show results in (for example) German. - If not available, show results in the next available language (which usually is English). SPARQL example: SELECT ?text WHERE { dbpprop:abstract ?text. OPTIONAL { FILTER langMatches( lang(?text), \"de\" ) } } The problem is that the query never chooses an available language when the preferred language is not available. For example, no results are returned if the following code is used: FILTER langMatches( lang(?text), \"he\" ) The same happens for other languages as well. Does anyone know of a solution to this? Thank you, Stephen Hatton Hi! I&#39;m trying to build localization into a DBpedia application, but I&#39;ve got a problem.

If not available, show results in the next available language (which usually is English). SPARQL example: SELECT ?text WHERE { < Hatton uStephen, your query simply asks to fill ?text if language \"de\"/\"he\" is available (with the OPTIONAL keyword the query does not fail), if not, ?text will be empty. You may look at \"Matching Alternatives\"[1], but I don't think there is a way to encode \"the next available language \" into a query. But: You may use UNION to define an order of preferred languages within the WHERE part. I would probably ask OPTIONAL for both, \"de\" and \"en\" & would solve the problem at application level.

"The first template that occurs in a wiki article defines the class of the entity"	"uHi guys, A recap of the issue we discussed last Friday during the telco follows. Enjoy Leipzig in the meanwhile! Cheers, Marco In the following article: 2 templates are used: 'personaggio' and 'fumetto e animazione'. As 'personaggio' comes first, the generated entity is typed as 'FictionalCharacter' i.e. 'personaggio' and lacks of the 'fumetto' type. Instead, the 2 templates should generate 2 different entities, 1 typed as 'personaggio' and the other typed as 'fumetto'. 1. We should investigate how big the problem is i.e. run analytics at least on the Italian wikipedia dump. 1a. If it's only a matter of some articles, then just modify the article source 1b. If the problem is big, then declare class disjunction i.e. owl:disjointWith axiom in the DBpedia ontology and raise an error when 2 templates map to disjoint classes Other examples: index.php?title=Alfredo_Binda&action;=edit uHi Marco, Thanks for the remainder. Currently we are short on developer time and, since you are mainly affected by this issue, can you create a script to quantify it?

It's not a problem for me either way, but my tools definitely complain, since they expect the types to match up with the type hierarchy.

"Semantic Publishing/Nanopublications and DBpedia URIs"	"uDear all, first of all I like to thank everybody who contributed to this enormously valuable project! I have a very special use case: I like to use DBpedia URIs/IRIs to formulate RDF triples as a representation of the content of a scholarly publication in the humanities. Therefore I am especially interested in the quality of abstracts to lemmata of abstract concepts and I am discussing this with the de.wikipedia community at the moment. But I also have at least one question for you: DBpedia URIs are only useful in this context, if they are persistently linked to a timestamp and the content of the abstract given at a particular time. Only then I can recover what the author might have meant when he or she published the RDF triples. Of course, it is also interesting to see, how changing definitions, etymology, semantics influence the statement later, but still you have to reconstruct the historical dispositions. I hope I could explain myself sufficiently and I am very thankful to any comments: Did I miss that DBpedia is already doing something like this and if not: have you ever thought about this kind of persistence?

Exhortations to many contributors to be more coherent at a structural level are not likely, I believe, to meet with much success. The motivations of contributors and editors are most often local within the KB space. Thus, in microcosm, many parts of these KBs can look pretty good, but when the scope extends more broadly across the KB, the coherence breaks down. There aren't many advocates for structure-wide coherence. As an advocate for structure-wide coherence and one who is not afraid to wade into the fray, perhaps you can work some useful magic. I'm dubious, but I truly wish you luck. Our approach, which we have been working on for some years episodically, with another episode due shortly, is to use a coherent structure (UMBEL, in our approach, which is a faithful, simplified subset of Cyc) to provide the TBox, and then to find defensible ways to map the entity and concept information in crowdsourced KBs to that structure. We have been talking about this for so long that it is time for us to complete our initial development and put something forward that you and others can similarly scrutinize. We hope to have something useful by this summer. Thanks, Mike On 4/15/2014 6:55 PM, Patel-Schneider, Peter wrote: uI agree that it seems harder to crowdsource ontologies.

I think that any crowdsourced artifact needs to have participants that spend considerable time on these tasks. It appears that the DBpedia ontologyhas not been subject to much of this kind of activity. Just today I went through the DBpedia class taxnomy and marked classes that were arguably misplaced. I found over 50 out of about 500 non-sport classes(and the sport classes probably all need some attention). The misplacement of DBpediaclasses is not justa problem with the DBpedia ontology, of course, as the DBpedia taxonomy is used to generate type statements for all DBpedia resources. The only aspect of DBpedia that makes this not quite so severe a problem is that many of the misplaced classes have few or no instances. However, some of the misplaced classes, e.g., FictionalCharacter, ChessPlayer, PokerPlayer, Saint, Religious, Monarch, Medician, Galaxy, Restaurant, Country, Grape, and Venue, have a significant number of instances. peter On 04/15/2014 07:16 PM, Mike Bergman wrote: uOn 4/15/14 8:55 PM, Patel-Schneider, Peter wrote: You can triangulate around these issues via other TBoxes that provide \"context lenses\" into DBpedia.

[1] G2D6HBO uThe trouble isn't that the current concepts are wrong or that yours are wrong but that the word \"Church\" means a lot of things to a lot of different people. Church Buildings are important landmarks and they get drawn on maps; they're often architecturally interesting and knowing about them helps you get around and talk to people about your environment so you don't always depend on existential qualifiers like \"the one runs the big the soup kitchen\" or \"the one that gets visited frequently by the bomb squad.\" It can't possibly harm your soul to know and to name these things. It is easy to describe these things because they have properties that are easy to populate such as date of construction, architectural style, etc. A trouble with the word \"Church\" is that it is culture bound. It's fair to say that a \"synagogue\" is a \"Jewish church\" and a \"mosque\" is a \"Muslim church\" and it's not unusual to see buildings that have been used by one Abrahamic faith be used for another. It's not unusual for the same worship space to be used by people of twelve or so faiths, Abrahamic or not. In the 'en' cultural zone I'd expect people to accept that a Shinto Temple which isn't too different from a Christian church in structure and function, is a 'Shinto Church'. In other cultural zones, a good word needs to be picked and a similar meaning promulgated. \"Religious Building\" could be determined by deed (in cultural zones that have a well-defined system of land title), but I know plenty of churches that own the building the pastor (and possibly his entourage) lives in and I wouldn't usually call that a 'Church', and some people wouldn't accept that the building that the church rents out for birthday parties and regularly runs a bingo parlor in is a 'Church'. For each large Shinto Temple there are perhaps 100s of small shrines that have a similar role in the landscape as larger churches (spiritually important for the participant of this place-based religion), yet don't have weekly or even monthly organized ceremonies at them. What you're talking about has something to do with \"Religious Organization\", but I don't think the Knights of Columbus or the Baptist Student Union are \"Church(s)\" even though in some sense the KoC is part of the Roman Catholic \"Church\". Maybe what you mean is \"Congregation?\" With this you can model that the Irish go to mass at 10am at St. Mary's and that the Italians go at noon. That three protestant denominations hold services at one 'Church' and that the Rabbi and his flock were there the previous day? Or that there exists, somewhere, a coven (with no name) that meets every full moon, preferably outdoors, and does a ritual that isn't particularly scandalous but is nevertheless secret and won't be documented as an instance in Wikipedia? The trouble will that for DBpedia is that what we work with is the output of the Wikipedians and their world view. A satisfying set of \"Church Building(s)\" can be easily had from the source material, but if you want a greatly improved and practical model of religious practice you'll need to be able to \"agree to disagree\" with Wikipedia.

On the other hand, the subclass relationship between military structure and building is entirely from DBpedia. Military structures are not necessarily buildings, so the DBpedia ontology should becorrected here. The situation with Church and its siblings isindicative of the choices faced. Wikipedia defines church as\"a religious institution, place of worship, or group of worshipers, usually Christian\". None of these are necessarily buildings, but many Christian places of worship are buildings. The instances of Church in DBpedia are largely populated from the French Wikipedia infobox Ãdificereligieuxwith type containing \"glise\". These entities all appear to be buildings.So in the end it seems reasonable to defer to Wikipedia here, and use the Church class for church buildings. Changing the name of the class to Church_(building) should also be done, but it may be that this is not worth worrying about, aslong as there is a comment that Church is for church buildings. Monasteryis populated in a very similar manner, but quite a few monasteries in French Wikipedia are not buildings, and not even architectural structures. To fix this problem requires moving Monastery outof Buildingand even out of ArchitecturalStructure. This is a change that I feel must be made, even though it goes counter to the indications in the infobox name. peter On 04/16/2014 09:36 AM, Paul Houle wrote: uI agree that a way forward would be to use a well-defined ontology, and set up themappings from infoboxes to map into that ontologyinstead of the DBpedia ontology.

Does anybody spot the root of all evil in this example?

All of these three ontology properties are object properties, therefore they expect a wikilink. The \"Infobox Ort in Argentinien\" converts the provinz and the url value into links, so that at the rendered wikipeda page you found the internal link to The DBpedia framework extracts the infobox property values and not the information that is rendered from it, therefore that information is lost. regards, paul uHi Paul, I don't know if I got you right. Do you mean that merely such properties can be extracted: [[some value]]? If that is true I wonder why also simple values (without the brackets) are extracted in other cases. For instance in |Lage=Südafrika is evaluated and the information does not vanish during the extraction process. Just test the mapping at Cheers, Bastian uHi Bastian, generally, if an infobox property is mapped to an ontology object property, the DBpedia framework \"searches\" for Wikilinks in the infobox property value. For instance a fictitious property: | country = World cup 2010 in [[South Africa]]. If this property is mapped to an ontology object property, the DBpedia framework would extract a triple with an object: . If the infobox property is mapped to an ontology datatype property with xsd:string as range, the framework would extract a triple with an literal as object: \"World cup 2010 in South Africa\"@en . In a case where an infobox value doesn't contain a link, but is mapped to an ontology object property, normally nothing would be extracted. But the framework do some simple entity recognition. In your example: \"|Lage=SÃ¼dafrika\" a Wikipedia article exists that has exactly the name of the property value: regards, Paul uHi Paul, ok now I get it. With your explanation in mind I'm just wondering how to circumvent the obstacles set by articles that use infoboxes like \"Ort_in_Argentinien\". The problem is that when using the template one has to select a specific province which is defined in a list of provinces: | [[Liste der Provinzen Argentiniens|Provinz]]: | {{#switch: {{{Provinz|}}} |Salta = [[Salta (Provinz)|Salta]] |Buenos Aires (Provinz) = [[Buenos Aires (Provinz)|Buenos Aires]] (Provinz) When these provinces' names do not correspond to the actual titles of the wikipedia articles the extraction of the specific property fails. So what possibilities do we mappers have to handle that problem? Or is it inevitable without restricting the syntax of infoboxes? Regards, Bastian 2011/4/4 Paul Kreis < >: uHi Bastian, yes, you hit on a weakness of the current mapping language. Right now, a mapper could do nothing. The mapping language doesn't provide a sufficient solution for this problem. We have this issue on our to-do list. A possibility could be to transfer the \"{{#switch: {{{Provinz|}}}\"-template with its abbreviations to a conditional mapping that defines constant values to ontology properties. regards, paul"

Basically i have a list of words and i have to map each of them to a DBpedia resource.

Anyway simple text search wouldn't be enought because of disambiguation issues, so i thought i can use Gabrlovich's ESA ( ) to retrieve a wikipedia page for each word in the list and then get the DBpedia resource relative to the wikipedia page. Because of my actual lack of expeience over SPARQL i don't know if there is a simplier way to achieve the same result. I would really appreciate if someone could help me both in extendind my SPARQL knowledge and in finding a better and simplier solution for the problem i'm trying to solve.

Use a SPARQL query like this to find out how often a particular property is used (to see if it's worth spending time on it): SELECT COUNT(*) WHERE { ?s dbpedia2:dateOfBirth ?o . } 4. Find example triples that use a particular property (to see *how* it's used, and if it's indeed interchangeable with another property): SELECT ?s ?o WHERE { ?s dbpedia2:dateOfBirth ?o . } The end result of this process could be triples like this: dbpedia2:dateOfBirth owl:equivalentProperty dbpedia2:birthdate . We could load this into the SPARQL endpoint then. Best, Richard uI've used the two you give: this gives two sets with a large degree of overlap and not that many new cases for the second class (foaf:Person). I suspect it be a case of diminishing returns to hunt for any more classes used to identify people. Done that. I found (by asking for an ordered result set) that these queries returned more than the allowed number of hits, so I added regex filters looking for: born birth died death place date and copied the resulting XML into a single document. I then sorted this, stripped out duplicates (e.g. placeOfDeath would be found by two of these searches), and hand-crafted the attached XML document, which attempts to group concepts together. This establishes that the \"obvious\" ones vastly outnumber the oddities. This is a bit depressing, I must say Still, I suppose you can still query the ones which aren't total cabbage. I assume that you would want there to be strict equivalence between the properties thus linked? I'm assuming so, in which case the number of equivalences will be quite small. There are part/whole type relationships between some of them, e.g. monthofbirth and dateofbirth cityofbirth and placeofbirth Can this type of relationship between properties be [usefully] expressed? Final question (for now): there are for example seven variants on \"birthDate\". Do I need six owl:equivalentProperty statements or 21?

I'm not sure. None of the properties have a strict formal definition, so it's hard to say if two properties are equivalent or not. Perhaps a good rule of thumb would be: If I query for either of the two properties, would the additional values returned from the other property improve the result? If it would, then we could assume equivalence. The first one not. In the second case, you can say: :cityofbirth rdfs:subPropertyOf :placeofbirth . Formally, this states: \"If someone's :cityofbirth is X, then their :placeofbirth if also X\", which makes sense. Note that it doesn't necessarily work the other way round. If it worked either way, then the properties would be equivalent. A good question. In terms of formal semantics, six are enough, and the others are implied by the OWL semantics. An OWL reasoner would would take care of that automatically. But for SPARQL queries against the DBpedia endpoint, which doesn't have reasoning built-in, it would make things simpler if we had all the equivalences. I propose to leave it at six for now, but would really like to hear what others think about this question.

The issue here is that no inferencing rules have been requested or created during the various data loads into Virtuoso. See: Kingsley uOK: attached is a text document containing what I think are 49 correctly-framed declarations of equivalence and sub-property-ness for various birth and death date and place properties. Are the equivalences the most helpful way round? (The \"standard\" property is on the right of the expression.) If not, it's trivial to change the XSLT to swop them round. More importantly, given Kingsley's comments, can we now do anything useful with these statements? The implication is that subPropertyOf _could_ be supported, but hasn't yet, and the doc he refers to makes no mention at all of owl:equivalentProperty (only owl:sameAs, which relates to classes not properties).

"DBpedia Data Quality Evaluation Campaign"	"uDear all, As we all know, DBpedia is an important dataset in Linked Data as it is not only connected to and from numerous other datasets, but it also is relied upon for useful information. However, quality problems are inherent in DBpedia be it in terms of incorrectly extracted values or datatype problems since it contains information extracted from crowd-sourced content. However, not all the data quality problems are automatically detectable. Thus, we aim at crowd-sourcing the quality assessment of the dataset. In order to perform this assessment, we have developed a tool whereby a user can evaluate a random resource by analyzing each triple individually and store the results. Therefore, we would like to request you to help us by using the tool and evaluating a minimum of 3 resources. Here is the link to the tool: details on how to use it.

Are you making it clear to people what the standard of performance is? Are we supposed to check stuff against a human reading of Wikipedia or actually verify the facts? When I see data quality problems in Freebase or DBpedia they often involve global properties that aren't detectable at the level of individual nodes. For instance, there are the two great trees of living things and geographical containment. Often these have obscure breakages at high level nodes that will break any algorithm that assumes these things are trees. And it generally turns out that things are sketchy at certain high level nodes where some taxonomists introduce levels of classification that others don't and don't get me started on those anglophone islands on the other side of the English channel. In cases like that you can't count on getting accurate answers from average people and your odds aren't even that good if you ask an expert. Certainly there is a lot of noise in the category assignments in Wikipedia. It might be reasonable to expect people to flag incorrect category assignments but without some global view, finding the ones that are missing (maybe 40% of them in some cases) is too much to ask. uAm 15.11.2012 19:44, schrieb Giovanni Tummarello: or issues.

"DBO ontology problems"	"uFollowing the announcement of Dimitris Kontokostas about migration to WebProtege, I thought I'd share some observations about the ontology itself. I can add more details if there's interest. I see these main problems with the ontology: 1. many classes and properties need better description 2. some properties are redundant or ambiguous. This is exacerbated by the lack of descriptions, e.g. it takes data examination to figure out that \"event\" means the same as \"sportDiscipline\" and should be eliminated. 3. a few \"syntax errors\" re classes and capitalization of properties, I think I wrote about those (DID I?) E.g. firstAccentYear rdfs:domain Peak,Volcano is not properly parsed (nor are multiple domains a good idea). 4. Mapping to external ontologies, esp. schema.org is not good. I also consider statements about owl:Thing to be useless. I'll write separately about this, but what's the chance the DBpedia maintainers will agree to emit separately: - the ontology mapping statements (filtering by namespace). I have a simple example. - data triples mapped to external ontologies 5. Specific properties (e.g. Person/height 6. Since domain/range are not taken into account by the mapped extractor, I think it's better to emit them as schema:domainIncludes, schema:rangeIncludes rather than rdfs:domain, rdfs:range (which have strict uncompromising semantics) 7. \"topical pages\" should use foaf:focus not skos:subject, I wrote about this The migration to WebProtege should take care of 3. I've played with WebProtege once but haven't used it. I hope it has as good collaboration features as MediaWiki, in particular subscribing to a class or discussions about it. If not: maybe we can have discussions in the Class/Property Discussion namespaces (which currently nobody uses), even though the definitions are in WebProtege.

"Introducing Sztakipedia"	"uHello, We have made an Intelligent Assistant for Wiki which puts dbpedia in good use, you might be interested in: I wanted to share this on this list for several reasons: 1) I wanted to say thank you for everyone who works on dbpedia, I think this is a great achievement. 2) Right now Sztakipedia is branded as an \"Intelligent Assistant\" which helps you in the boring work of finding links, references, infoboxes, categories etc., while creating a wiki article. But it has been designed as a two way tool from the very beginning - what I mean by that is that we could have the users to help improving dbpedia data only in some a very-nonobtrusive way of course. 3) I am interested in your thoughts and remarks in general - you surely have good ideas about what could be done with this agent in the editor! 4) And finally, the most important thing : recently I was asked to write a book chapter about the ways of using dbpedia data in mashups. Naturally it is my task to do the research and compile a good overview on how dbpedia is used in the wild as part of web interfaces. I am also familiar with the many white papers on this topic.

We already have integrated snowball, so in theory we are able to process any language snowball supports ( don't do the stemming, in theory tf-idf can still work but problems arise with languages like Hungarian - where we concatenate funky suffixes to the words to signal past tense, posessive, modalities, etc>From dbpedia we use the list of pages so its not optional. -Infobox recommendation is similar - it relies on the XML dump, and the corresponding dbpedia infobox data. If we have those we can start a kind of machine learning (actually done by lucene). To be able to display the infobox fill form with help, we also need certain xml files for infoboxes. -there is a co-occurence learning phase, it relies on XML dump and tf-idf, and is needed for book recommendation. But book search works without that. -Book recommendation is quite simple - you can use the english books, which are often referenced in non-english texts as well. To have non-english books we need library catalogs in some processable format. That can be an issue, I have not even found one for Hungarian yet. However, we could change this part and use library API's like Z39.50. There are always performance issues with those but I can see that sooner or later we need to support those. So to sum up, adding a new language is a piece of work right now and we need certain resources. However, we will try German and Hungarian in this year. We will try to simplify the process and will do our best in supporting more languages. But we always gonna need some help form locals to the given country - library data and testing.

Wow, I have some faint memory that I have heard about spotlight but I did not know that it is in this advanced phase!

But if I'm correct I can deduce programmatically the correct string from the dbpedia uri so its just a note really. About SMW integration: in theory SzP should work with any kind of mediawiki with the vector skin - and also is a good vehicle to send any kind of suggestions and wikitext parts to the editor. So it should work. What I'm not familiar is how relation suggestion is done. Is it similar to the spotlight solution? About collecting feedback: absolutely.

The factforge query editor does a \"reasonable\" job of combining data from DBpedia and Freebase and making them queryable through SPARQL. Like most similar things, it doesn't provide a consistent point-of-view. If you look at the sample queries at the bottom you often see them using multiple predicates to get information that came in through different sources. owl:sameAs gets used to glom together Freebase and DBpedia concepts; I don't know where they got their owl:sameAs statements, but I know that if you use the ones that come with Wikipedia you'll find some concepts end up getting lost or confused in big Katamari balls. If you want to write simple queries and get consistently good results you need some process where you clean the data up, decide what you believe when there is contradictory information and all of that. It would really be great if we had some system that could represent that \"john thinks that mary said Lady Gaga is a man\" but the strategy of throwing it all in a triple store and hope people aren't going to notice they're getting bad results doesn't cut it. I think DBpedia has a different philosophy than Freebase. DBpedia combines a Wikipedia dump with a rulebox that creates a set of triples. The rulebox isn't capable of doing deep cleanup on data. The \"correct\" way to fix something in DBpedia is to fix the data in Wikipedia. If I've got an automated process that say, reconciles places with Geonames and inserts geographic coordinates for 200,000 places, the only way I can get this data is get it into Wikipedia, and that's a very difficult proposition because there are many different infobox templates for different kinds of locations in which coordinates are represented differently. On the other hand, if you want to bulk insert data into Freebase, or fix a fact that's wrong, it's pretty easy to do.

It's difficult to come up with a better subjective importance score than select count(*) { ?s :wikiPageWikiLink dbpedia:J._Edgar_Hoover . } I use Hoover as an example, because DBpedia, Freebase and other popular knowledge bases don't do a good job of documenting his career. Perhaps you could define events for cops (?s :arrested ?o) and bureaucrats (?) but then you've got to populate them. Hoover, however, used his power to protect his privacy, and a real accounting of his notorious career would be impossible. A historical figure as important as Hoover collects relationships with many other entities, and even if they aren't precisely ontologized, they are captured in the page links. This gives him a fighting chance to rank higher than the Foo Fighters or some other entity that secretes large numbers of well-formed and ill-formed bibliographic entries.

"Semantic Web Journal Special Issue on Quality Management of Semantic Web Assets (Data, Services and Systems)"	"uThe standardization and adoption of Semantic Web technologies has resulted in a variety of assets, including an unprecedented volume of data being semantically enriched and systems and services, which consume or publish this data. Although gathering, processing and publishing data is a step towards further adoption of Semantic Web, quality does not yet play a central role in these assets (e.g., data lifecycle, system/service development). Quality management essentially refers to activities and tasks involved to guarantee a certain level of consistency and to meet the quality requirements for the assets. In general, quality management consists of the following four phases and components: (i) quality planning, (ii) quality control, (iii) quality assurance and (iv) quality improvement. The quality planning phase in the Semantic Web typically involves the design of procedures, strategies and policies to support the management of the assets. The quality control and assurance components have their primary aim in preventing errors and to meet quality requirements pertaining to the Semantic Web standards. A core part for both components are quality assessment methods which provide the necessary input for the controlling and assurance tasks. Quality assessment of Semantic Web Assets (data, services and systems), in particular, presents new challenges that were not handled before in other research areas. Thus, adopting existing approaches for data quality assessment is not a straightforward solution. These challenges are related to the openness of the Semantic Web, the diversity of the information and the unbounded, dynamic set of autonomous data sources, publishers and consumers (legal and software agents). Additionally, detecting the quality of available data sources and making the information explicit is yet another challenge. Moreover, noise in one data set, or missing links between different data sets, propagates throughout the Web of Data, and imposes great challenges on the data value chain. In case of systems and services, different implementations follow the specifications for RDF and SPARQL to varying extents, or even propose and offer new, non-standardized extensions. This causes strong incompatibilities between systems, e.g., between the used SPARQL features in the query engines and support features in RDF stores. The potential heterogeneity and incompatibility poses several challenges for the quality assessments in and for such systems and services. Eventually, quality improvement methods are used to further enhance the value of the Semantic Web Assets. One important step to improve the quality of data is identifying the root cause of the problem and then designing corresponding data improvement solutions. These solutions select the most effective and efficient strategies and related set of techniques and tools to improve quality. Quality improvement metrics for products and services entails understanding and improving operational processes and establishing valid and reliable service performance measures. This Special Issue is addressed to those members of the community interested in providing novel methodologies or frameworks in managing, assessing, monitoring, maintaining and improving the quality of the Semantic Web data, services and systems and also introduce tools and user interfaces which can effectively assist in this management. Topics of Interest We welcome original high quality submissions on (but are not restricted to) the following topics: - Methodologies and frameworks to plan, control, assure or improve the quality of Semantic Web Assets - Quality exploration and analysis interfaces - Quality monitoring - Developing, deploying and managing quality service ecosystems - Assessing the quality evolution of Semantic Web Assets - Large-scale quality assessment of structured datasets - Crowdsourcing data quality assessment - Quality assessment leveraging background knowledge - Use-case driven quality management - Evaluation of trustworthiness of data - Web Data and LOD quality benchmarks - Data Quality improvement methods and frameworks e.g., linkage, alignment, cleaning, enrichment, correctness - Service/system quality improvement methods and frameworks"
"Hello - I hope I'm in the right area and sorry, if I'm not"	"uHello, I hope I'm in the correct area, but if not, sorry (and hopefully someone can direct me). I'm active on a WIKI for \"Final Fantasy XI.\" It is at: In the associated forums, I posted an idea for an application, which could use information found in the wiki. This is information is in different area (it deals with monster levels, locations of monsters, as well as, combat skill levels of the various jobs). The thread is at: NOTE: Presently, the monsters and locations have their own individual pages, as well as category pages (I've noted sometime they won't agree on all data). These pages also follow a standard template (well, are supposed to follow). One person suggested there might be programs, which have the ability to extract information from WIKI pages for applications to use. My goal would be two fold (one beyond the thread) 1) Meet the goals of a reverse skill up application, as outlined in the thread. 2) Create a page for the wiki - wiki.ffxiclopedia.org - listing all the monsters known by the wiki and their attributes. To keep this page current / in sync with individual monster pages, well, this application would exist. So, I'm wondering is this the place to find an application / ability to scan and collect information for the FFXIclopedia? If no, ah, is there somewhere to go to obtain this help? If yes, great, where do I go to learn and/or get help? NOTE: One short coming to the WIKI concept I see is keeping stuff in sync. In \"our\" case an example is monster level. Say the individual monster page says the level is 83 - 85, YET the category page for the monster's type can list the same monster but give the level as 84 - 86. I understand why this happens, as each page is independent but yet refers to the same information. What would be nice is a way / method to keep the same data in sync across a wiki (or multiple wikia). For example: If one could save a monster and its attributes in a database and then in the page reference the entry (e.g. monster_name.level (e.g. Goblin_Beastman.level) would generate the 83 - 85 and thus everywhere the monster and its level would be in sync). Anyway, thanks for listening and I look forward to any / all positive help I obtain from the list. Thanks!!!

A typical example is Note that you can see dbpedia-owl:abstract and rdfs:comment information about this topic in de and fr, but nothing in en, despite the fact that there's a wikipedia page about this topic. Here's the page in wikipedia If I had to hazard a guess about what's going on here, there's a 'contents' box up at the top of the page, but the actual abstract you want is under the 'General' heading, and reads something like \"The university hospital of Heidelberg is one of the largest and most renowned medical centers in the Federal Republic of Germany. It is closely linked to Heidelberg University Medical School (Heidelberg University Faculty of Medicine) which was founded in 1388 and is thus the oldest within the Federal Republic of Germany. The university hospital is actually made up of 12 hospitals, most of them being situated on the New Campus (University of Heidelberg), about 10 driving minutes away from the old town.\" Is this just a case that the extractor isn't handling correctly. I can send a list of many more of these if it would help. uPaul, To me this looks rather like an issue for Wikipedia. Our extractor extracts the text before the first heading of an article as abstract and this corresponds to the suggested authoring style in Wikipedia [1]. So I have the impression that your 45k articles should be send as input to the Wikipedia authors as a list of articles, which should be checked for proper abstract handling. Given the 3.5M articles overall this is just slightly more than 1% of all articles. We could of course also try to implement some workaround in DBpedia, when we start doing that for all issues in Wikipedia, we will never be done. Would be interesting how many of the 45k articles without abstract use \"General\" (or something similar) as their first headline - maybe we could then try to cover at least some of these obvious and common cases, although I thing it would be more sustainable to write a bot for Wikipedia, which deletes \"General\" headings, when they come first in an article.

For instance, most of the mass of the ocean (water) is the ElementOxygen. If a system also understood that people breathe \"Oxygen\" it could come to the wrong conclusion that people can breathe in the ocean. Note that freebase treats oxygen as a \"Chemical Element\", but also a \"Medical Treatment\"; the Medical Treatment is the use of the diatomic gas, which doesn't appear to be otherwise documented in Freebase. The text in wikipedia does a good job at explaining the taxonomy of substances: reading it, it makes clear distinctions between elements, compounds, allotropes, etc. So far, generic databases have done a poor job of taxonomizing \"stuff\". It seems to me that the problem is tractable, but people have stopped short of the work it takes to do it: an introductory chemistry textbook does a good job of explaining it that bypasses the \"representational thorns\" that Cyc and other efforts have gotten caught up on. u[I left dbpedia-discuss on the distribution, but I'm not sure why they got tacked on at the very end of the conversation.

Unfortunately, there are lots of folks who would be happy to make use of a well structured data set when it's done, but not a lot of folks (so far?) who are interested in contributing time and effort to making it better structured. Unless someone figures out how to break the circle, we'll all be left bemoaning the inadequate and \"annoying\" state of the data. So did you click the little \"split\" flag on the edit page? Better yet, did you use one of the split tools to cleave the properties into two sets and distribute them among the appropriate topics for the gas and the chemical element?

"Geocoordinate issue on de & fr dbpedia"	"uHi, There has been word [1] for several months now that geocoordinates on de.dbpedia get rounded to integers and are thus useless. I've found the same issue on some infoboxes in fr.dbpedia. Is this a known issue and is there a fix planned? The root cause is that an unhandled format (dd/mm?/ss?/[NSEW]) is used for coordinates. Indeed the GeoCoordinatesMapping class assumes that when there are only two properties for latitude/longitude they are necessarily decimal, which is not true. It then calls doubleParser.parse which results in keeping only the degree part. The same format is also used by the {{coordinate}} template [2] which is said [3] to be the current standard in de.wikipedia and could thus be added to GeoCoordinateParser and GeoCoordinateParserConfig once the issue is fixed. Here are two test cases, first with infobox (rounded), second with {{coordinate}} template (ignored): * * If nobody is addressing this issue I will try to submit a patch later this year, since I just had my very first look into extraction framework and am not familiar with scala. Cheers, Nono {1] [2] [3] comparison uHi Nono, Yes there are still problems for coordinates not given as doubles; As I understand there is a regex in for expressions fo the kind 43°50'51''N 18°21'23''E, bit not for the format you say. A solution may be to add a second regex. The template \"coordinate\" is missing in I see no issue related on I can help if you need. Cheers, Julien uThank you for your answer Julien. Yes, my idea was to add a second regexp like private val SingleCoordinate = \"\"\"([0-9]{1,2})/([0-9]{0,2})/([0-9]{0,2}(?:\.[0-9]{1,2})?)?/([NSEW])\"\"\".r Then the simplest option would be: 1) insert a new case entry leveraging it twice at before the basic latitude/longitude one, to handle the {{coordinate}} template once added to GeoCoordinateParserConfig. 2) add a match test at resorting to doubleParse.parse() However this is a bit against encapsulation rules. Having everything parsing related inside the parser class would be nicer but we cannot directly return a GeoCoordinate instance since we need to parse one coordinate at a time. If you want to implement one of the solutions, feel free to do so. Cheers, Nono On Fri, Jun 21, 2013 at 11:07 AM, Julien Cojan < >wrote:"

A correct ontology of administrative divisions is a difficult problem because the laws that define administrative divisions are different in different countries and even inside smaller level administrative divisions. In a week or so I'm going to vote for elected officials in an administrative division called Caroline. Mail to me is addressed to something called Brooktondale which has no government but does have government buildings and a post office. Another village, Slaterville Springs, has no government but does have a special tax assessment. New york state has nearly 20 different types of local government (what Freebase would call a /location/citytown.) Every point in New York, including the great wilderness of the Adirondacks, is part of a municipality (4th level administrative subdivision), but there are places in New Mexico that are unincorporated and that only belong to a county (3rd level administrative subdivision.) Perhaps the U.S. is a more difficult case than most other countries because a :U.S._State has a high degree of autonomy. Medicaid, our program that provides health care for the indigent is administered by individual states, and supported by taxes that I pay to my County. In most U.S. States I can buy a bottle of wine at the supermarket, but in New York I have to go to a liquor store and not on Sunday, except for the one liquor store in town that (inexplicably) is open on Sunday. Don't forget that the U.S. also has non-:State components such as DC, Puerto Rico, and Guam. In other countries, a \"2nd level administrative division\" means something very different. Since there are another 200 or so countries \"1st level administrative divisions\" in the world (nobody is sure about the exact right number) the problem is way worse than that. In geonames, there are \"Nth level administrative divisions\" where N=14, and maybe if you let N go to 5 or 6 sometimes, you're doing about as well as can be done for the world. Now you might think :City isn't so bad but that's not the case. :Los_Angeles is a :City that is inside a :County. :New_York_City is really a :City (4th level) but is has five counties (3rd level) inside of it. :London and :Tokyo (which everyone expects to be on the top-10 :City list) aren't even cities, they are administrative subdivisions that contain cities And there's no clear distinction between a :Village, :Town, and :City, any more than there is between a :Hill and a :Mountain. Now, it's a fair complaint that the extraction system behind DBpedia is less than perfect, but I think the ontology behind it is correctly designed and detailed for the job it has to do. \"Vernacularizing\" it so that :Tokyo is a :City and \"specializing\" it so it knows everything about administrative divisions in Indonesia are interesting enrichment projects, but what it aims to do right now is about as useful as is practical."

"Current state of the SPARQL endpoint"	"uHello, as pointed out earlier, I'm having some issues with the new SPARQL endpoint. I'm currently using DBpedia to generate dictionaries for a task in an information extraction class I'm taking. For this task, I need a list of entities, e.g. actors. Consider the following query: SELECT ?name WHERE { ?a . ?a ?name } With DBpedia 3.2, this would work just fine. With the current release, the query will time out after a while, giving me a partial result list. This actually is a feature called \"Anytime\" queries. [0] I wonder if enabling the Anytime feature is a good idea - not because I can't get my list of actors, but because it's broken, undocumented and proprietary: Kingsley Idehen wrote: That's not exactly in the \"SPARQL Protocol for RDF\" recommendation. There is no way right now to let a SPARQL-compliant client know there are more results. AFAIK, it is also impossible to set these timeouts using the SPARQL Protocol. I don't think proprietary protocol extensions are the right thing for an Open project. Additionally, handing out different result sets for the same query depending on what kind of data is cached and how far subordinate clauses from *previous* queries have been evaluated (see [0]) sounds broken. In fact, I don't believe the SPARQL W3C recommendation allows that (section 12.5, \"Evaluation Semantics\"). I do acknowledge that handling web-scale data sets presents a problem, but I'd rather see a query language which can do proper chunking of results instead of breaking SPARQL. Anyways - I tried to work around this issue by using the LIMIT and OFFSET solution sequence modifiers. The W3C recommendation states: \"Using LIMIT and OFFSET to select different subsets of the query solutions will not be useful unless the order is made predictable by using ORDER BY.\" - so throw in an ORDER BY as well. This will break after some iterations: 22023 Error SR353: Sorted TOP clause specifies more then 10100 rows to sort. Only 10000 are allowed. Either decrease the offset and/or row count or use a scrollable cursor SPARQL query: define sql:signal-void-variables 1 define input:default-graph-uri SELECT ?name WHERE { ?a . ?a ?name } ORDER BY ?name LIMIT 100 OFFSET 10000 Any ideas? Regards, Michael [0] ?id=1494 uMichael Haas wrote: Micheal, The only issue here is that it isn't documented properly. And the real question is simply this: how do you answer queries at Web Scale? Do you seriously expect a SPARQL endpoint to deliver complete results for every conceivable query (good, bad, complex) in predictable time, really? If you prefer the old behavior, no problem, we switch off this feature, but don't jump to conclusions re. its purpose. btw - I could simply have opted for the basic single server edition of Virtuoso, and in retrospect, maybe that's what should be out there. Do remember, we are offering a service at our cost to the community, please do remember this. Kingsley uKingsley Idehen wrote: Thanks for the follow-up. However, It's still not working. With DBpedia 3.2, I got ~25000 results: :~/uni/IE/group3$ wc -l oldseeds/actors.txt 26932 oldseeds/actors.txt Now, it's more like ~150: :~/uni/IE/group3$ wc -l seeds/actors.txt 132 seeds/actors.txt (Please note these numbers are after post-processing, ie removing duplicates etc). This is the exact same source code and queries I'm using. Either the amount of actors in Wikipedia reduced dramatically, the extractors are broken or something is not right with the SPARQL endpoint. Thanks for the update - you previously suggested it was the \"Anytime Query\", that's why I was looking into that. Regards, Michael uWell, at least I can say it's neither the amount of actors in Wikipedia nor the dbpedia extractors. grep -c 30912 Best, Georgi uMichael, Please retry: SELECT ?name WHERE { ?a . ?a ?name } The issue has nothing to do with \"Anytime Query\" feature and everything to do with misconfiguration of the Virtuoso cluster instance. uKingsley Idehen wrote: The real issue is that it is not SPARQL. Some things you're doing are not in the SPARQL W3C recommendation. Handing out partial results to SPARQL results is what I would consider broken behaviour, especially as there is no way to tell the SPARQL client that there more results available. SPASQL does not count, and HTTP response (codes) are not specified in the W3C recommendation (other than 200, 400 and 500 - as far as response codes are concerned, of course). As I said, I acknowledge this problem. It is not easy to solve and I do not have a good solution handy. There is no need to be offended. I'd prefer a technical discussion - I'm sorry if I have insulted you. From your follow-up: > BTW - set the timeout to \"0\" and the \"Anytime Query\" feature is disabled re. the endpoint. Can you please point me to the part of the SPARQL Protocol recommendation [0] where it talks about setting timeouts or somesuch? It might be a good idea to disable the anytime query feature for those using the SPARQL protocol and do some kind of opt-in for those using clients who can speak your extensions. I'd rather have a HTTP 500 when my queries fail instead of getting possibly wrong data without being told there's something missing. Of course, I could all be wrong and what you're doing is standards compliant - feel free to prove me wrong :) [0] uMichael Haas wrote: Embracing and coherently extending the SPARQL standard isn't a crime as long as you don't break the core standard. Do you seriously think we should wait for consensus re. how and when SPARQL matches and exceeds SQL (which is darn important)? btw - I am sure you've seen: and rewind to a query language without aggregates and update capabilities as part of a message that reads: Web as a structured database that facilitates powerful analytics etc Kingsley uGeorgi Kobilarov wrote: uKingsley Idehen wrote: How is 40000 records out of almost 100000 a good result?

Georgi uKingsley Idehen wrote: I just wanted to echo what Kingsley said here and add one caveat of my own. A *key* part of driving a healthy standards process is extension & innovation performed by implementations. If implementations blindly adhered to the standard, there would be no experience to draw on to motivate and coalesce around designs for future specifications. The sort of innovation done by Virtuoso and many other SPARQL engines is key to a healthy future for SPARQL. The one caveat is that I do agree that, in general, extensions really ought to be compatible with the core standard. This means that if a query is asked or a request made via the SPARQL protocol, it's almost always best for the implementation to behave as per the spec. This allows generic SPARQL clients to safely and consistently access a service, while other clients with knowledge of your extensions can still take full advantage of them. Lee uLee Feigenbaum wrote: Lee, To clarify I meant: extend cleanly i.e, above the core. Thus, people that want to work with the core can do so without hitting the basic vs extension quandary due to poor partitioning of a given extension and the core :-) Exactly! uLee Feigenbaum wrote: That is my opinion as well - and it basically echos what I just wrote to Kingsley in an private email. Regards, Michael uKingsley Idehen wrote: Then can you please explain how your normal run-off-the-mill SPARQL client implementing the SPARQL protocol can turn off \"Anytime Queries\"? It's not like I haven't asked this before, maybe I'll get an answer now :) Regards, Michael uHi Michael, If SPARQL client do not specify 'timeout' parameter, then no \"Anytime Queries\" will be in effect. If there is noticeable difference between 3.2 and 3.3 SPARQL endpoints results it is not \"Anytime Queries\" unless 'timeout' option is used, imho it is something to be debugged.

You continue to miss my points, profoundly. Please step back, and then re-read this entire thread, and then you will more than likely discover the source of my angst re. your comments. Kingsley uMichael Haas wrote: If you recall, in the prior release of DBpedia we would return timeouts for certain queries. Do you recall that behaviour? \"Anytime Query\" is about a new dimension that allows you to set timeouts and retries so that you can do more. As with most things, in a few years time when \"Anytime Query\" is implemented elsewhere by other Databases that offer query parallelization, you will at least have a URI back to this thread :-) Also remember, I told you that the initial problem had zilch to do with the \"Antytime Query\" feature, it had everything to do with an error in the configuration of one of the cluster nodes. FWIW - cluster nodes are about horizontal partitioning and query parallelization, so if a node is mis-configured it can distort the behavior the whole. Kingsley uMitko Iliev wrote: Thanks. I was under the impression Anytime Queries were enabled unless you passed a specific parameter to the SPARQL endpoint, which is AFAIK not possible using the SPARQL protocol. You are the first person to clarify that. Regards, Michael uKingsley Idehen wrote: My entire point was that enabling Anytime Queries by default is a bad thing, especially when there is no way to turn off this behaviour using the SPARQL protocol. It turns out that it is disabled unless you specify the timeout parameter - if you had told me this, we'd both have saved a lot of time. In fact, you told me I needed to set specific parameters to disable it. It goes without saying that you also missed my points. I acknowledged several times that the Anytime Query feature has valid use cases, I just said it mustn't be enabled by default as it is incomptaible with the SPARQL protocol. In any case, my concerns are invalid. Thanks. Regards, Michael uKingsley Idehen wrote: As it turns out, the answer to this question is \"it doesn't need to\". There's nothing wrong with innovation. You seem to imply I am wrong - I am not. You simply missed my point :) I realize that. I was solely reacting to the fact of Anytime Queries becoming the default - which was not true. Sorry 'bout the drama. Regards, Michael uMichael Haas wrote: Micheal, Just read the text of: finput field is). You could have just clicked \"Run Query\" and seen \"&timeout;\" at the end. You could have also done a backspace and hit \"enter\" to see it is a clean extension. Instead, you decided to offer a lecture of SPARQL compliance etc. Kingsley uMichael Haas wrote: I am sure I missed some of your more salient points, but the treatise on SPARQL conformance was quite distracting, especially bearing in mind how much time and effort actually goes into making this instance available to the world. We started with a simple issue that became a two-way riddle due to a cluster node mis-configuration. Thus, in my eyes, I was naturally looking beyond the basics; assuming you had seen the text in the /sparql page and its default setting, since you were talking about large results and what appeared to be missing data etc. Great so were all set :-) uKingsley Idehen wrote: \"Execution timeout, in milliseconds, values less than 1000 are ignored\"? I did read that, but I assumed that entering a value less than 1000 would just use the default timeout of the Anytime Query feature instead of disabling it. It has only become apparent (to me, at least) that it *is* a clean extension (ie opt-in) after Mitko joined the conversation. Let me sum this up: * I'd consider it a bad thing (\"broken\" from my first posting in this thread) if Anytime Queries were enabled by default. They are not enabled by default. Everything is good. * Anytime queries are good, if supplied with a good protocol - which no doubt you're going to do. I'm looking forward to seeing some documentation on this feature - I've been working with other triple stores which shall remain nameless which would benefit from such a thing. * Weekends are good. I hope everyone is going to have a great one :) Regards, Michael uKingsley Idehen wrote: I did insist on that point because nobody dispelled my worries (till Mitko came along). ;) especially bearing in mind how And it is appreciated. I used to use the /sparql website a lot for testing queries - these days, I am mainly using the ARQ libs which don't do the Anytime Query stuff. That probably explains why I assumed it was enabled by default - because it was the first thing you suggested when I talked about missing result sets. Or it was the fact there are two things to SPARQL: the SPARQL protocol and the SPARQL query language. Yep! Have a nice weekend.

"Confusion about DBpedia international datasets and chapters"	"uHi everyone, I'm looking to formally describe the structure of the DBpedia datasets and I'm a bit confused about the difference between the main DBpedia download folder ( language dumps available there (for example German: datasets and downloads on the other hand (for example German: If I download a dump from here: open it, choose an arbitrary resource and try to open its URI, the data in the dump and in the LOD of the chapter will not be the same, right? Because in the \"main\" DBpedia download directory is different data than in the chapters download directory (and in turn its SPARQL endpoint and LOD). How does this make sense? There is a DBpedia German 3.9 dataset and a different DBpedia German chapter dataset. I expect the same is true for the other chapters? Why is the chapter's data (at least the dumps) not aggregated at the main DBpedia? I think it is very confusing and hard to understand. It is also impractical. If I want the latest DBpedia for all languages, I have to go to every single chapter, find their download pages (which don't even have the same URI pattern for the different languages), check if their data is more recent than the \"main\" Dbpedia's data, then download it or get the data from the \"main\" download page. Can a procedure be introduced to somehow alleviate this issue? I think conversions of all Chapters. confused regards, Martin uHi Martin, The reason the downloads differ is historical. On the one hand, some of the country chapters were established before the main chapter started extracting anything except english and on the other, the country chapters \"should\" produce dumps more frequently. I agree with you that the country chapter dumps should be mirrored or linked on the main downloads page. We should discuss this issue at the next dbpedia developers telco on Wednesday 02.07.2014 .

Maybe we will extend the coverage of labels and abstracts a bit, but this is something Open Link has to green light, since they are hosing the endpoint. As a solution for your use case: If the answer your query, try combining both endpoints in your query with a federated query . Or set up yout own endpoint: Since you are comparing all resources with the equivalent from Wikidata (so it seems), you would get even better results if you set up your own DBpedia endpoint loading the labels_wkd_uris_xy_ttl.bz2 as opposed to the en_urisfiles we loaded in the official endpoint. Those are the labels of a language normalized to existing Wikidata resources, which are usually more numerous than those normalized to English resources. For the query above the following list of datasets loaded would suffice: /xy/labels_wkd_uris_xy.ttl.bz2 /xy/interlanguage_links_xy.ttl.bz2 /wikidata/interlanguage_links_xy_wikidata.ttl.bz2 Where xy would be replaces by the language(s) you are interested in.

Regarding the content of the \"good\" description Why do we have the \"artist\" property value as text, although it is clearly a link in the infobox at The result is that it's not obvious to discover this work from the artist URI, except akward browsing through categories :( Moreover contains reference to the said painting, does not link to the paintings URIs, only full-text description Seems the same is true for any list in I agree the format of WP lists pages is far from regular, but many of them are flat bullet-point lists which should be easy to parse. On my wishlist for 2010 :) Thanks Bernard uHi, I would like to repeat this issue, I came across it only today. It seems to me that in the current DBpedia data set URIs are stored in encoded form, therefore only the first URI yields the \"correct\" data. This was not the case in the 3.2 and 3.3 releases, which we could verify with our local replicas. This is actually a serious issue, because it practically renders printed DBpedia URIs containing parentheses useless: when readers type them into the webbrowser they usually end up with the second variant, where only limited data is returned. Best, Bernhard uHi Bernard, On 22.01.2010 10:21, Bernard Vatant wrote: The second URI is apparently only available since the YAGO dataset contains decoded links to DBpedia URIs. Therefore there are only those YAGO types visible. The artist property value is only a literal since the infobox for paintings allows users to enter only the artist names and converts them (the whole string) to links. We don't map list elements to our ontology. Also I don't think that from the category itself we could conclude much for the contained list elements.

"Mapping types at the instance level"	"uIt's pretty easy to map some types between dbpedia and freebase; for instance, both systems agree on what a \"Person\" is, so we can say the \"Person\" type is equivalent. If we find that, say, a Yago class contains a list of Persons, then we can say that that the Yago class is a subclass of Person, even the freebase \"Person\". That's all pretty easy. Then there are the types that don't quite align. Dbpedia's \"Organization\" class corresponds most closely to \"Employer\" in Freebase. Employer is a duck type, that is, you'd prove that X is an employer if there some person Y such that X employs Y. Most significant organizations employ, and few non-organizations employ (Is \"Dalia Dippolito\" an employer because she hired a hit man to kill her husband?) There's still the problem that a volunteer FireDepartment is not an employer, but other FireDepartments are. Dbpedia's \"Organization\" which contains FireDepartment, FootballTeam, Business and such, is a more useful type to me than \"Employer\" is. We don't have a good language for describing the relationship between \"Organization\" and \"Employer\". \"Employer is a subclass of Organization\" comes close, but it might not be exactly true. Now, a set of \"Organizations\" could be extracted from Freebase by: (i) discovering freebase types which are subclasses (or near-subclasses) of Organization, and (ii) filtering non-Organizations out, if they exist No we've got examples where: (a) freebase can help dbpedia (finding the missing {ersons), and (b) dbpedia can help freebase (creating a missing type) There are a lot of practical issues in expressing complex type mappings with things like OWL and SKOS, but there is a simple method that works with well-implemented standards. Rather than describing a type mapping, a type mapping can be expressed as a set. For instance, I could go through the dbpedia"

"Special chars in property URIs (was: DBpedia 3.0 Dataset problems.)"	"uJens and all, I'm moving this thread which started off-list to the DBpedia discussion list. It's about weird characters in some infobox dumps, especially the japanese infobox dump. I'll start with a summary of the problem. The names of template variables in some infoboxes have international characters. For example, a german-language infobox might have a template variable \"größe\" (meaning \"size\"). Our current approach to deal with this is to: 1. apply the standard Wikipedia %-encoding to the variable name in order to create a property URI in the namespace, e.g. 2. convert the %XX triplets into _percent_XX because property URIs containing the % character cannot be serialized as RDF/XML. The property URI now looks like this: The problem is that we end up with some very long and ugly property names! Certainly no one would want to use properties like this in a SPARQL query! They also mess up the Pubby HTML view. This hasn't been a big problem when we only did infobox extraction from the English Wikipedia, because it contains very few of those troublesome template names, but it's a huge problem now that we do infobox extraction for many languages. On 15 Feb 2008, at 12:11, Jens Lehmann wrote: I can think of three possible approaches: 1. Simply drop the troublesome triples. If a triple can't be serialized as RDF/XML, just ignore the triple. We considered this for the English infobox extraction, but obviously this is not a good solution for the international infobox dumps which have a lot of those triples. 2. Encode the % character as something shorter than \"_percent_\", e.g. just a simple dash. This is still ugly but at least not so long: The characters we can use without problems are: letters, digits, underscore \"_\" and dash \"-\". 3. Use real international characters in the URI, e.g. I'm not quite sure if this is possible. RDF supposedly supports IRIs (the new style of i18ned URIs that can contain Unicode letters), and XML can certainly use these characters in element names, so it *should* be possible. But this is somewhat uncharted territory, someone would have to dig through the relevant specs to see what exactly is or is not allowed, and from prior experience I would expect a lot of trouble with tools in our toolchain that are not quite Unicode-ready. I guess if we want to go with option 2, then this could be done quickly. Option 3 would probably have to wait for the next release. We may also decide to do 2 now and look into 3 later. What do you all think? What should we do? Richard uHi I definitely want this third approach, not only for properties, but also for the resource names (URIs). %encoded names are totally unusable for non-western language users. Instead, if DBPedia employs IRI for those names, it will be really very, very good news for us ! I have certain amount of experience to use Japanese characters in RDF URIrefs (IRIs), and found most RDF libraries can handle IRIs. Exceptions are characters in compatibility areas in Unicode (e.g. Japanese counterparts to ASCII signs/punctuations etc), which some libraries cannot use as local name of an URI (not necessarily causes errors, but cannot generate correct local name). I'd not be able to involve in programming itself, but happy to provide information as far as I can. best regards, uMasahide, On 18 Feb 2008, at 14:22, KANZAKI Masahide wrote: With regard to resource URIs (as opposed to property URIs), it's worth pointing out that Wikipedia itself uses %-encoded URIs for article pages. I think this is a good reason for DBpedia to also stick with %-encoded URIs, because there is some value in the direct correspondence between Wikipedia URIs and DBpedia URIs, just replace with (Most browsers show the international characters when displaying %- encoded URIs, and automatically do the %-encoding when international chars are entered into the URL bar, so it's easy to forget that Wikipedia also does %-encoding everywhere under the hood.) That's good news. Okay, I do have some questions for you. If you serialize a document with Japanese chars in class or property URIs as RDF/XML, how do the characters show up in XML element names? Do they really show up as Japanese characters in the XML names? Are there examples of RDF vocabularies or ontologies that have Japanese characters in URIs? This would be useful for testing purposes. In your experience, does QName expansion usually work with Japanese characters? One of the main attractions with allowing i18n chars in URIs would probably be that you could write SPARQL queries like this: SELECT * WHERE { people:ç¥å´æ­£è± foaf:interest ?interest . } Does something like that work in practice? Grateful for any information, Richard uHi Richard, 2008/2/19, Richard Cyganiak < >: I don't agree, but this should be another topic (it may go too long ;-) Yes. We can use Japanese characters in XML names, i.e. element names and attribute names without any problems. I publish a few vocabularies that include Japanese names as properties (eg.[1], though I don't see much instances suitable for test, since people tend to use its English-named properties). Yes, no problem. I prepared a small example on my site that includes one property \"$BL>A0(B\" (which means \"name\" in English). Try the following SPARQL, and you will get the result ?nick \"masaka\".

He suggested using automated creation of lists with \"edit requests\" that could be processed manually by Wikipedia users.

A lot of work went into most articles, they are a very carefully balanced compromise between many people with opposing viewpoints. It's understandable that authors will be unhappy about some bot blundering through thousands of articles. Let me guess. What would the Tennis Player article say? Much of the same as the Tennis article? No, repetition is bad, even in Wikipedia. So: A person who practices [[Tennis]]. But such an article is a bit pointless. A redirect makes more sense. The reader is directed to a page that gives her all information needed to understand what a tennis player is. Wikipedia is designed for human readers. It's an encyclopedia, not an attempt at domain modelling. And shouldn't Tennis Player be a category anyway?

"Accuracy of coordinates in dbpedia/wikipedia & freebase"	"uI've recently put up a site that uses coordinate information from Freebase and Dbpedia, and I'm starting to think about how to clean up certain data quality problems I'm encountering, for instance, see: In this particular case, I've only got data from dbpedia, which drops the point a few hundred km from where it really is It's obvious that this is a bad one because it's right in the middle of Lake Erie. Freebase doesn't have any coordinate for this thing (seems to me that it should), and at the moment, Wikipedia has the right coordinates (at least on Google maps I see a big factory building) My guess is that wikipedia might have been wrong at one time, and has had it corrected. It's also possible that the conversion wasn't done right in dbpedia, since coordinates are represented differently in a few hundred different infoboxes. It seems to me that both the number of points and the quality of points in Wikipedia has been improving dramatically over the last two years About a year ago I plotted the points for Staten Island Railroad stations and found that the railroad was displaced a few km east and ran right under the middle of the Tapan Zee bridge Now it's much better. I can find examples where: (a) dbpedia is right and freebase is wrong (for instance, a town in continental Europe gets its longitude sign flipped and ends up with the wrecked ships west of the UK uOn 9/27/10 4:42 PM, Paul Houle wrote: uIl 28/09/2010 00:00, Kingsley Idehen wrote: uOn 9/28/10 3:43 AM, Roberto Mirizzi wrote: uHello Paul, On 27.09.2010 22:42, Paul Houle wrote: You can check this by comparing the regular DBpedia and DBpedia Live: Indeed, the coordinates have changed, so there was probably an error in Wikipedia.

Note that for large objects (e.g. Russia and other countries) both LinkedGeoData/OpenStreetMap and DBpedia/Wikipedia contain a reference point, which is a good representative for this object.

I remember some time ago, I was looking for the DBpedia live page about the programming language PHP, and the abstract reported: \"PHP: Problèmes d'Hygiène Personnelle\". :-) Unfortunately vandalism is quite widespread in WIkipedia. Probably, at least nowadays, there are better datasets than DBpedia that offer more accurate geolocation, as you pointed out with LinkedGeoData. Besides the problem of geographical coordinates, as I mentioned in the previous message, I think it's a problem doing \"reasoning\" on resources belonging to two different datasets, linked through owl: sameAs, and having inconsistent information.

"A detailed analysis of the ArchitecturalStructure portion of the DBpedia ontology, proposals included"	"uWikipedia defines building as \"a man-made structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place\" and \"intended for human use or occupation\" [ suggests examining examples of non-building structures, where are listed the Eiffel Tower, the Golden Gate Bridge, roller coasters, water towers, gates, fortifications, and transmission towers. However, DBpedia includes RollerCoaster, WaterRide, Gate, MilitaryStructure, Treadmill, and WaterTower as subclasses of Building. Each of these are either explicitly listed as non-building structures or are obviously non-building structures given the exclusions in Wikipedia. It turns out that many of the classes that are subclasses of Building in the DBpedia ontology are either disjoint from Building or are not truely subclasses of Building. Similar problems affect ArchitecturalStructure. The definition of architectural structure is unclear, but neither public transit systems nor parks are architectural structures at all, except possibly in very unusual cases, even though these are subclasses of ArchitecturalStructure in the DBpedia ontology. Here is my in-depth analysis of ArchitecturalStructure and its subclasses, building on the observations above. I have used the appropriate pages from English Wikipedia and instances from DBpedia 3.9 to back up my arguments. ([NC] ([NEC]) means no (English) comment on the class.) ArchitecturalStructure [NC] Building is a subclass of Architectural Structure. However, the Infobox Wikipedia defines building as \"a man-made structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place\" and \"intended for human use or occupation\" [ suggests examining examples of non-building structures, where are listed the Eiffel Tower, the Golden Gate Bridge, roller coasters, water towers, gates, fortifications, and transmission towers.

I have used the appropriate pages from English Wikipedia and instances from DBpedia 3.9 to back up my arguments. ([NC] ([NEC]) means no (English) comment on the class.) ArchitecturalStructure [NC] Building is a subclass of Architectural Structure. However, the Infobox building is too broadly used in English Wikipedia, e.g., mapping for Infobox building to check for special cases, such as building_type including \"tower\", and map them into the appropriate classes. This is the most complex proposal here because of the overuse of the building infobox. [NC] AmusementParkAttraction is excluded implicitly from building. There are no instances of this class that I could find. Proposal: Move the class to be a direct subclass of ArchitecturalStructure. RollerCoaster is excluded explicitly from building. No further change is needed for this class. [NC] WaterRide is excluded implicitly from building. No further change is needed for this class. [NC] Arena is excluded explicitly from building, presumably because of open-air arenas such as populated directly from the nl:Infobox stadion. Proposal: Move the class to be a direct subclass of ArchitecturalStructure and make no changes to the mapping rule. [NC] Gate is excluded implicitly from building. Proposal: Move the class to be a direct subclass of ArchitecturalStructure. HistoricBuilding needs no change. [NC] MilitaryStructure is not a subclass of building, as it includes fortifications. The class is also used for military bases, which are not even architectural structures, e.g., incorrectly use the Infobox military structure. Proposals: Move the class to be a direct subclass of ArchitecturalStructure. Fix mappings for this infobox to check for type Military base, and then instead use type Place. The comment on the class needs to be changed to conform with architectural structure. Mill is not a subclass of building as many mills have no enclosure and are thus are not buidings. The only mills listed are in the Dutch Wikipedia, and are mostly buildings or at least building-like. One exception is http://nl.dbpedia.org/resource/De_Meent_(Langerak). Proposal: Make this class a direct subclass of ArchitecturalStructure. Even though most mills currently in DBpedia could be considered to be buildings, there will be very little lost here. [The comment needs to be changed to broaden to its actual use.] Treadmill, Watermill, WindMotor, and Windmill should remain as subclasses of Mill and thus need no changes besides being removed from Building. ReligiousBuilding the physical presence of many religious congregations are only parts of buildings, but it appears that in DBpedia only includes those meeting places for religious congregations that are buildings. Monastery is not a subclass of building because many monasteries include multiple buildings and other structures, and are thus not even architectural structures, e.g., http://fr.dbpedia.org/resource/Gndevank and http://nl.dbpdia.org/resource/Makarjevklooster. Instances of this class are populated from Infobox Ãdifice religieux, checking for type MonastÃ¨re. Dutch instances of this class are populated directly from nl:Infobox klooster. Proposal: Make this a direct subclass of Place. Some information will be lost for monasteries that are single buildings, but this is a minor loss. Abbey is not a subclass of building because some abbeys include multiple buildings and other structures, and are thus not even architectural structures, e.g., http://fr.dbpedia.org/resource/Abbaye_de_Lucedio Proposal: Make this a direct subclass of Place. Some information will be lost for abbeys that are single buildings, but this is a minor loss. Church is not a subclass of Building. \"A Church is a religious institution, place of worship, or group of worshipers, usually Christian\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church. However, all (or almost all) churches in DBpedia are religious buildings, mostly free-standing, as only important Churches have been placed in DBpedia. Proposal: Do not make any change, except putting a comment in the DBpedia ontology that this class is for church buildings only. It would be better to rename this class as something like \"Church_(building)\", but I do not know if this change is worth it. [NC] Mosque is in the same situation as Church. Synagogue is in the same situation as Church. Temple is only populated in Japanese DBpedia, and is likely in the same situation as Church. [NC] Shrine is not a subclass of Building as almost all shrines are not buildings, being simple and small. Proposal: Make this a direct subclass of ArchitecturalStructure. Skyscraper needs no change. [NC] Tower is not a subclass of Building, as many towers have no interior space. Proposal: Move the class to be a direct subclass of ArchitecturalStructure. [The comment needs to be fixed.] Lighthouse is not a subclass of Building, even though many lighthouses are buildings or building-like. \"A lighthouse is a tower, building, or other type of structure\" [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse]. Proposal: Leave as as direct subclass of Tower, which will move it out of Building. [NC] WaterTower is excluded explicitly from building. Proposal: Leave as as direct subclass of Tower, which will move it out of Building. Venue is not a subclass of Building as many venues are open air, e.g., http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hollywood_Bowl, or parts of buildings. Venue is populated directly from Infobox venue. Proposal: Move the class to be a direct subclass of ArchitecturalStructure. [NC] Theatre is not a subclass of Building as some theatres are open air, e.g., http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delacorte_Theater, and other theatres are parts of larger buildings or structures e.g., http://dbpedia.org/resource/Circle_in_the_Square_Theatre. Proposal: Leave as a direct subclass of Venue, which will move it out of Building. [NC] Casino, Castle, Factory, Hospital, Hotel [NC], Museum [NC], Prison [NC], Restaurant [NC], ShoppingMall [NC] are all functional facilities, which are often either complexes of buildings and other structures, e.g. http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toronto_General_Hospital, or parts of buildings or other structures, e.g., http://dbpedia.org/resource/Casino_Lisboa,_MacauRobuchon_Ã¡_Galera1 Proposal: Move all these to be direct subclasses of Place. Dam needs no change. [The comment needs to be adjusted.] Garden is not a subclass of ArchitecturalStructure as many gardens are just plantings of flowers with no associated structure. Proposal: Move this class to be a direct subclass of Place. [NC] Infrastructure needs no change [NC] Airport is questionable as a subclass of ArchitecturalStructure, but probably needs no change. [NC] LaunchPad [NC], Lock [NC], PowerStation [NC], and NuclearPowerStation [NC] need no change. RouteOfTransportation [NC] is questionable as a subclass of ArchitecturalStructure, but probably needs no change. Bridge needs no change. [NC] PublicTransitSystem is not a subclass of RouteOfTransportation or even ArchitecturalStructure, e.g., http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts_Bay_Transportation_Authority. Proposal: Make this class a direct subclass of Organisation. [NEC] RailwayLine, Road [NC], and RoadJunction [NC] need no change. [The commment on RailwayLine probably needs to be adjusted.] Tunnel is not a subclass of RouteOfTransportation as not all tunnels are routes of transportation, e.g., http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tunnel_of_Eupalinos. Proposal: Make this class a direct subclass of ArchitecturalStructure. RailwayTunnel [NC], RoadTunnel [NC], and WaterwayTunnel [NC] are all subclasses of RouteOfTransportation. Proposal: Make these classes subclasses of both Tunnel and RouteOfTransportation. Station, MetroStation [NEC], and RailwayStation [NC] need no change. NoteworthyPartOfBuilding needs no change.

Thanks in advance Regards Amit kumar Tech Lead @ Yahoo! Sent from Samsung Mobile Hi, I have been trying to run the Dbpedia Extraction Framework (DEF) on en wikipedia dump. Unfortunately DEF page extraction threads kept crashing with memory issues. After various experiments and help from DEF mailing list, I was able to narrow it down to few particular pages and the mappingExtractor. I was pointed to look at the table mappings. It turns out that when we changed the code to ignore the table mappings coming from dbpedia.org, the code runs fine. There are currently only a couple of table mappins present @dbpedia .

Thanks in advance Regards Amit kumar Tech Lead @ Yahoo! Sent from Samsung Mobile uHi, I think the only effect is that you will miss some data on automobiles, as there is but the rest will be there. Minor note: You mentioned that there are a couple of mappings, but I only see one: Do you have a hint on which article it crashes? In case you need that data and someone fixes the extractor at some point (unfortunately I won't have time for that), it would also be possible to run it stand alone in order to generate the missing data at a later point (saves a bit of time compared to doing a full dump).

This is a known problem but the framework doesn't handle this type of information. Whenever there is a mapping the framework expects a class definition and it either assigns it in the article resource or in a new \"intermediate\" resource ( in the case of multiple defined mappings ) To solve this I think we should add a \"noMapToClass\" property in the templateMapping and whenever the framework reads that definition it just adds the mapping output directly to the main resource without rdf:type info Would you like to help in this regard?

The typo has been corrected after the release of dbpedia 3.8 [2], in fact in live DBpedia there is no entity known to be using that template. My questions are then: 1) are the statistics calculated on dbpedia data or on wikipedia live data? 2) are the templates with numOfProperties < minPropertyCount only hidden from the templates or also not processed during mappings extraction? Hiding them from the statistics makes sense to me, but if it is possible to create mappings for them I would like to understand how a DBpedia mapping contributor can be informed about the existence of such templates. I personally use the statistics page to decide what to work on first and in case of a missing template in that page, it would be difficult for me to get to know other possible candidates. Moreover, the Starbox_* templates are used in more than 2k articles, which could lead us to at least assign proper types to a big set of entities. 2) what is the approach used by the dbpedia extraction framework in case I agree with this approach and I would love to contribute. I just need a bit of time to get used to the dbpedia extraction framework code and also with Scala :P Also, wouldn't it be possible to avoid creating a new intermediate resource when there are multiple templates which map to the same ontology class? If the resource has been already assigned a class, and another template in the article maps to the same class then you do not create another \"fake\" resource and add ontology properties to the original resource. Otherwise you create a new resource and add properties to that Does that make sense?

The idea would be to build on the existing code at bitbucket: Potential industry partner: TILDE (Tatiana) Source code: TBX Standard: Contact person: Philipp Cimiano, John McCrae, Victor Rodriguez-Doncel T8: [Confirmed] Converting multilingual dictionaries as LD on the Web The experience on the creation of the Apertium RDF dictionaries will be presented. Taking as starting point a bilingual dictionary represented in LMF/XML, a mapping into RDF was made by using tools such as Open Refine . From each bilingual dictionary three components (graphs) were created in RDF: two lexicons and a translation set. The used vocabularies were lemon for representing lexical information and the translation module for representing translations. Once they were published on the Web, some immediate benefits arise such as: automatic enrichment of the monolingual lexicons each time a new dictionary is published (due to the URIs ruse), simple graph-based navigation across the lexical information and, more interestingly, simple querying across (initially) independent dictionaries. The task could be either to reproduce part of the Apertium generation process, for those willing to learn about lemon and about techniques for representing translations in RDF, or to repeat the process with other input data (bilingual or multilingual lexica) provided by participants.

The task consists of converting text annotated by Babelfy into RDF format.

Feel free to join the discussion: is there any scheduling for the next dump? We are anxious about knowing how Generalized dumps for the entire (Internationalized) DBpedia usually happen twice a year. The international chapters are free to release their data in any release cycle they see fit. So you may just run the extraction framework on your side and tell us how many triples you get.

Pablo is correct on the distinction (ontology - property). If this is not the case, you should map them both to the same DBpedia ontology property. If the infobox has both of them defined then you will get 2 triples, otherwise you will get only one. At least you should :-) You could take a look at [1]. I updated it recently. We could also create an I18n FAQ page for similar questions. Maybe the Spanish guys can gather all their questions in an page (i.e. [2]) and we could help them write the answers :-) Cheers, Dimitris [1] [2] Hi, EXTRACTION It seems that the extraction process reads the properties found in the infobox instances, without checking if those properties are in the infobox definition . is that so? I think so. This is correct. The infobox definition is not taken into consideration Eg:Â In the statistics of (es) Ficha_de_futbolista we can find the property 'altura' as one of the most used, but that property is not in the infobox definition.

I wouldn't say that the overlap in infobox fields proves that they are equivalent. It only shows evidence that they are related. In this particular case, isn't writer a subproperty of author? Authors of songs could be writers, composers, etc.? But authors of (textual) books are writers? I do not know the best way to handle this (Jona?), because I imagine that before merging two properties in the ontology we need to make sure that all infobox fields in all languages will still make sense after the merge. Perhaps we need to flag every affected mapping (via discussion page?) & alert the chapters to the change, which then need to give an ok at the discussion page? Any better ideas? Also, in this particular case it may be safer to \"merge up\" from the more specific to the more generic, at the cost of losing information (specificity).

The problem is not with Yago, but potentially with its integration into DBPedia (I didn't investigated further than by reading your mail). What one have to take into account when using Yago is that these concepts (as Queen) come from WordNet, so one concept has, in most of the cases, more than one word sense. Word senses are tagged with the WordNet word sense number (0231).

"How to build a meaningful Taxonomy from Wikipedia Categories?"	"uHi, Iâm trying to leverage Wikipedia Category Network for a semantic processing application. A set of Wikipedia articles are extracted from the document and I want to build a meaningful hierarchical taxonomy using Wikipedia categories. In my experiments, I found that the original category network of Wikipedia is really messy. For example, when some articles are mentioned in a document, it leads to the whole category network! I havenât use DBpedia before; I just really interested to know, if I leverage DBpedia, is it possible to have a meaningful taxonomy of categories with hyponym relations? x>\"  uThe strength of the Wikipedia categories is that there are a lot of them and a lot of statements matching instances to categories. The weakness of categories is that they are completely disorganized. There are two good strategies for using the categories. One of them is to treat them abstractly and use them as inputs for numerical algorithms. For instance, you can use algorithms such as Kleinberg's Hubs and Authorities where categories are treated as hubs and instances are treated as authorities. Similarly you can create similarity scores based on the categories shared between items. I've used wikipedia categories to create my own well-defined categories such as \"things related to New York City\" or \"obscene things\" or \"things related to skiing\" In all of these categories you have things that are easy to ontologize, such as ski areas, and other things such as that are not easy to ontologize. Generally I've made these by doing waves of expansion and contraction, traversing the graph and adding inclusion and exclusion rules. In the past with half-baked tools I've been able to create good categories of 10,000 or so members in a day or so. With good tools it ought to be possible to work faster.

From the mappings wiki ( extract only 49 equivalencies. These numbers are rather small. Am I missing something, is there a data set containing these equivalencies somewhere? Best regards and thanks for any insights, Basil uWikipedia infoboxes contain very specific information about things and are thus a very valuable source of structured information that can be used to ask expressive queries against Wikipedia. The DBpedia project currently extracts three different datasets from the Wikipedia infoboxes. 1. The *Infobox Dataset* is created using our initial, now three year old infobox parsing approach. This extractor extracts all properties from all infoboxes and templates within all Wikipedia articles. Extracted information is represented using properties in the properties directly reflect the name of the Wikipedia infobox property. Property names are not cleaned or merged. Property types are not part of a subsumption hierarchy and there is no consistent ontology for the infobox dataset. Currently, there are approximately 8000 different property types. The infobox extractor performs only a minimal amount of property value clean-up, e.g., by converting a value like June 2009 to the XML Schema format 200906. You should therefore use the infobox dataset only if your application requires complete coverage of all Wikipeda properties and you are prepared to accept relatively noisy data. 2. The *Infobox Ontology*. With the DBpedia 3.2 release, we introduced a new infobox extraction method which is based on hand-generated mappings of Wikipedia infoboxes/templates to a newly created DBpedia ontology . The mappings adjust weaknesses in the Wikipedia infobox system, like using different infoboxes for the same type of thing (class) or using different property names for the same property. Therefore, the instance data within the infobox ontology is much cleaner and better structured than the Infobox Dataset, but currently doesn't cover all infobox types and infobox properties within Wikipedia. Starting with DBpedia release 3.5, we provide three different Infobox Ontology data sets: - The *Ontology Infobox Types* dataset contains the rdf:types of the instances which have been extracted from the infoboxes. - The *Ontology Infobox Properties* dataset contains the actual data values that have been extracted from infoboxes. The data values are represented using ontology properties (e.g., 'volume') that may be applied to different things (e.g., the volume of a lake and the volume of a planet). This restricts the number of different properties to a minimum, but has the drawback that it is not possible to automatically infer the class of an entity based on a property. For instance, an application that discovers an entity described using the volume property cannot infer that that the entity is a lake and then for example use a map to visualize the entity. Properties are represented using properties following the schema. All values are normalized to their respective SI unit. - The *Ontology Infobox Properties (Specific)* dataset contains properties which have been specialized for a specific class using a specific unit. e.g. the property height is specialized on the class Person using the unit centimetres instead of metres. Specialized properties follow the schema (e.g. The properties have a single class as rdfs:domain and rdfs:range and can therefore be used for classification reasoning. This makes it easier to express queries against the data, e.g., finding all lakes whose volume is in a certain range. Typically, the range of the properties are not using SI units, but a unit which is more appropriate in the specific domain. All three data sets are available for download as well as being available for queries via the DBpedia SPARQL endpoint.

"Getting Freebase onto the Semantic Web"	"uHi John, John Giannandrea wrote: This would be great. Getting the data out on the Semantic Web as Linked Data also don't have to be a big effort as you are already having everything that is needed in place. I think for the first iteration it is completely OK if you define a new set of URIs for your schema. As a second iteration you could replace terms from your schema with terms from well-known vocabularies like FOAF or SKOS. 1. there would be a URI for each topic in Freebase and dereferencing this URI over the Web would return a RDF description of the concept using a Freebase specific schema. 2. this URI would be interlinked with other data sourcesin the LOD cloud, so that people could use Ssemantic Web browsers to navigate from these data sources into the Freebase data and so that Semantic Web crawlers can find and index the data. So, a minimal effort approach to getting Freebase onto the Semantic Web could look like this: 1. Define URIs for all your concepts, somethink like 2. Deploy a Linked Data wrapper around your API that returns an RDF description of (in the example above) the film when somebody dereferences the URI above. A very easy way to implement such a wrapper would be to just tweek the PHP script that we are using for the RDF Book mashup. The script is found at 3. Interlink this RDF Version of Freebase with other data sources. The simplest option here would be to interlink Freebase with DBpedia as both dataset contain Wikipedia article IDs. So what you would do is to add a RDF link stating that a specific concept in Freebase is the same as a concept in DBpedia to the RDF you return when one of your URIs gets dereferenced. For instance: owl:sameAs 4. You would send us an RDF file containing these RDF links for all Freebase concepts and we would load it into DBpedia and also serve these links. I think all this could be done within 3 days work and would allow Linked Data browsers, like the ones listed here to access and navigate between both datasets and would allow crawlers, like the ones listed here to index both datasets. What do you think? Technical background information about the whole process is found in After his, one could start thinking about also providing RDF dumps, so that people could load Freebase and DBpedia together into a RDF store and do whatever they want with the data. Or think about using well known terms from other vocabularies and ontologies. Using terms from well-known vocabularies as well as serving the data using different vocabularies is both important, but in my opinion something for the second step. First step: Publish linked data. See what people do with it. Cheers Chris"

"DBpedia datasets and their encodings"	"uHello, Can you please explain me the encoding procedures that DBpedia uses for the datasets? It seems that everything was encoded from MacRoman, which is not a good thing for people working on non-Mac machines (I develop on a Mac, but the production environment will be a Linux, who does not have the slightest idea what is the MacRoman encoding). Take for instance the DBpedia resource of the writer 'José Saramago', represented as resource Jos%C3%A9_Saramago> on the datasets. I normally work on UTF-8, and I had to write a little script (in the end of the mail) to figure it out the encoding used, giving: Encoding José Saramago in ISO-8859-1: Jos%3F%A9+Saramago Decoding Jos%C3%A9_Saramago in ISO-8859-1: José Saramago uNuno, On 2 Apr 2009, at 12:44, Nuno Cardoso wrote: We use UTF-8 everywhere. There is no MacRoman in DBpedia. Your text editor saves your source files in UTF-8, but your compiler/interpreter interprets them in MacRoman. That gives rise to the funny effects you are seeing. > So, I must force MacRoman to properly encode entities to DBpedia> SELECT * WHERE { ?p ? That's UTF-8, not MacRoman. MacRoman would be Jos%8E_Saramago. MacRoman is a single-byte encoding, thus the fact that the single character 'é' has been encoded as two octets '%C3%A9' should already tell you that you're not looking at MacRoman. The fact that US-ASCII characters remain unencoded while other characters are multi-byte encoded is a very strong clue that you're looking at UTF-8. I hope you realize how ironic your comments are! We use exactly the same encoding as Wikipedia: There is no such thing as an unencoded URI. You simply cannot have a character like é in a URI. When you enter into your browser, then your browser automatically encodes the URI (using UTF-8 follow by ) before sending it to the server. That's why it *appears* like unencoded URIs work in your browser. In reality, they wouldn't even be valid URIs. It is needed because RDF property names that contain the percent character cannot be serialised in RDF/XML. In general, to get from URIs to human-readable strings, don't mess around with the URI, but find the rdfs:label property of the resource. This advice holds for most RDF data. In DBpedia, it works for all instances (in the /resource/ namespace), and it works for all properties from the english-language infobox dataset. It does currently *not* work for properties in other languages, because their labels are not loaded into the DBpedia RDF store. But they are available for download. The portugiese one is here: Unfortunately, the labels in the dump are badly broken: \"popula_percent_ e3_percent_ a7_percent_ e3_percent_ a3o\" . The literal should read \"população\". It's a bug. (It would probably be a good idea for the DBpedia admins to load those dumps into the store after the bug has been fixed.) We already use UTF-8 everywhere. We cannot fix \"charset hell\" with new dataset releases. \"Charset hell\" exists because most developers don't care about Unicode or character encodings, even though they should. Internationalization is hard, unfortunately. Best, Richard uHello Richard, Yup, I realize that the problem/confusion is more on my side. Anyway, thanks by clearing out stuff. I've worked around a little more, and I have two comments: - The best approach is, in fact, as you said, to use the rdfs:label property of the resource. Regardless of the encoding hell that's happening on URIs, this should avoid it on SPARQL queries. - The properties indeed have a bug like you noticed. I'm sort of wrapping properties into objects with my own labels to tackle this problem. Are you planning a release soon?

"Version 0.2: Add your links to DBpedia workflow"	"uDear all, Based on the feedback, I have updated the workflow to add your links to DBpedia: (Thanks to Sarven Capadisli and Søren Roug, who already contributed several thousand links. ) Here are open issues: 1. Metadata and provenance info: First we would need to agree on what kind of metadata, we want to keep and secondly, we probably need an expert to make an example and help us with the vocab. These might be helpful: I would be happy, if we could just say: * this linking file was modified by contributions of the following github users * Then have some property where these users could add their comments and documentation (e.g. how the links were created). * information into which graphs the datasets should be loaded and whether they should be available in the main graph and via Linked Data * maybe some statistics, e.g. which linking properties are used (these can be loaded automatically) So in a nutshell: provenance, attribution, documentation, statistics and access. 2. We need to decide, which kind of data is allowed (see other threads) 3. I would like to add some people to the githib repo and create a *link maintenance committee* . For the beginning, everybody who contributed a dataset, would become its maintainer and merge other contirbutions to the same dataset. Please email me, if you would like to join such a committee.

"limited sparql query results?"	"uHello everybody, I'm new to this list. I'm using dbpedia sparql endpoint for my thesis project at university. I'm developing a software that allows the user to easily make queries to the dbpedia sparql endpoint. While trying some queries i noticed that some of them (or all of them?) make dbpedia return a truncated reply. I can check this trying to put an OFFSET that makes me see that other results are there but they are just not returned all at once. Is this something i can achieve? Do you have any hint for me to get all results somehow? Thank you for your time. Regards. uHi Alessandro, By \"truncated\" I presume you mean it is not possible to retrieve more that 1000 rows per query, which is an intentional restriction on the dbpedia sparql endpoint to protect it from mis-use ie someone inadvertently or otherwise overloading the service querying large result setsr. Thus as you have done below, to obtain larger result sets use LiMIT and OFFSET to traverse through the data in chunks if required.

"mappings with semantic mediawiki"	"uhi dbpedia, I'm really excited about being able to contribute to the dbpedia schema. I think using mediawiki to compose dbpedia ontologies is a thoughtful and original approach. it is going slowly. and I always feel like I'm screwing something up. has anyone considered installing semantic mediawiki to allow html forms, and bulk edits? It's a really clever extension that I think could give us a quick visual ontology editor. I made this - when I was thinking that the challenge was finding new wp infoboxes to do, but really, the challenge is recreating the existing ontology right?

"dbpedia-links: Recommendation for predicate "rdrel:manifestationOfWork" ?"	"uHi *, we[1] want to provide links between lobid and dbpedia. We would like to use an other predicate as the recommended ones[2]. lobid describes manifestations of library resources, e. g. books. We find that predicates like \"owl:sameAs\" do not fit , because the dbpedia resources often don't only describe books but also other forms of manifestations (e .g. a play or a movie). Thus we use the predicate rdrel:workManifested[3] to link our manifestations to dbpedia resources, e. g.: . This \"means\" : the lobid-resource is a \"physical embodiment of an expression of a work\", and that work is the dbpedia-resource (while work is defined as \"A distinct intellectual or artistic creation\"). As for the dbpedia_links we would like to use the inverse predicate - that would be rdrel:manifestationOfWork[4] . This would imply that these dbpedia-resources are rdf:type rdrel:Work[5] (we find that quite fitting, although not every wikipedia entry is actually a \"work\" (e .g. [6] is rather a \"manifestation\" - sure someday someone will correct this entry ). What do you think - should rdrel:manifestationOfWork be recommended in our case? -o [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Five_Go_Off_to_Camp uHi Pascal, I merged your links into the repo. Very good, we will include them in the data base soon. I changed the readme to adjust for your requirements. Basically you have a 1:n mapping and thus you need a domain specific link predicate. I added this and other things to the readme: 1. (strict) All N-Triples files must be alphabetically sorted without duplicate triples for better diffs. This is in accordance with the Unix command: sort -u . 2. For a list of currently used predicates (might be extended easily, write to list), see the file predicate-count.csv - For 1:1 mappings we recommend to use these: owl:sameAs, umbel:isLike, skos:{exact|close|}Match - For 1:m, n:1 or n:m mappings it seems to make sense to use domain-specific properties such as Additionally, you can include types, which result from inference of the usage of the domain-specific linking property, e.g. the rdfs:domain of the property. E.g. rdrel:workManifested is rdfs:domain rdafrbr:Manifestation, which entails that DBpedia entries should be of rdf:type rdafrbr:Manifestation. 3. Note that we also count links to other classes as links, so if you want to add an external classification using rdf:type as linking property, that is fine as well. I also included a predicate count: 880414 437797 330620 11970 10089 9273 2081 312 http://dbpedia.org/ontology/spokenIn Thanks again Pascal, Sebastian Am 03.05.2013 16:15, schrieb Pascal Christoph: uHi Sebastian, Am 06.05.2013 12:54 schrieb Sebastian Hellmann : :) I've adjusted[1] a misunderstanding resulting from my incorrectly first post , where I wrongly stated that: To be correct, it should be \" that the dbpedia entries are frbr:Works (not frbr:Manifestations).

While we don't want to discuss this here and now we want to make you aware of arising problems: While we think an encyclopedia generally describes a kind of abstract \"work\" rather than a concrete \"manifestation\" (e. g. a concrete edition of a book), we find that others classify dbpedia resources in a different way. E .g, if I understand correctly, the \"bookmashup\" dataset seems , like lobid, to describe *manifestations* of books, not *works*. But the bookmashup links with predicate \"owl:sameAs\" to dbpedia resources. These different approaches might result in a contradictionary assumptions. This is another example why the \"owl:sameAs\" predicate should be used with great care. thank you Sebastian - looking forward to see links from dbpedia to our lod service :) pascal [1] uBookmashup came from an earlier time and maybe it makes sense to rethink owl:sameAs for bookmashup. They are of class foaf:Document. The only problem is, that we need a more general property to query such links. Use case is to query all outgoing links for all books: Current: select * Where { ?s rdf:type . ?s owl:sameAs ?o } If we start replacing owl:sameAs this gets more difficult: select * where { ?s rdf:type . ?s ?link ?o .

And umbel:isLike suggests a closer match than there might be. I think both makes sense. Weaken owl:sameAs to rdfs:seeAlso and allow adding domain-specific properties. or might be a frbr:Item or even a frbr:Expression. It shouldn't be two or more of these, though, as according to the general FRBR model they are disjoint. E.g. the FRBR core ontology (one of the different FRBR ontologies) reads: owl:disjointWith , , . But we better not start a FRBR discussion here. Usually, they absorb much time that is better spent elsewhere and don't lead to anything productive. Having said this, it might be we made a bad choice using these FRBRish properties in lobid.org.

I think we should use both: rdf:seeAlso and manifestationOfWork and also add the rdf:type FRBR:Work to DBpedia. I created two issues: I would be grateful, if you had the time to tackle them By the way, having these two triples: rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Document . rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Document .

"dbpedia -> Freebase mappings, a cautionary tale"	"uIn our last episode, I was trying to construct a list of countries that are 'going concerns'; that is, not Austria-Hungary. I decided a reasonable approximation could be had by creating a 1-1 mapping between dbpedia and country codes. It's easy to get iso country codes out of Freebase (one MQL query returns them all,) so then it's a simple matter of using the Fb <-> Dbpedia mappings to send them back to freebase. Wrong. After I took out redirects, I found that this procedure mapped ISO country codes to multiple pages in dbpedia for 90 countries; if these were all obscure places, that would be one thing, but fbase:/en/japan mapped to a large number of topics in freebase, even after removing redirects Here's some raw triples from the NT dump just so you get the idea: . . . . . There are a total of 44 of these in the dump. A lot of these are redirects to dbpedia:Japan (easy to zap) and they all make sense as being aspects or components of 'Japan', even in some of them are a little batty, like \"Area 11\". For me, there's the immediate problem that, if I want to key my items to dbpedia, I need to establish (more or less) and that's it. So far as end users are concerned, there's got to be some single entity that corresponds to a country, and that entity has to be correct. Now, for me, the practical answer to use fbase:/en/japan as my key. Those of you who are using OWL reasoning, however, had better note that adding the freebase->dbpedia mappings to your copy of dbpedia will considerably change the meaning of your database."

"wikipedia errors and dbpedia refresh period"	"uI'm currently writing a simple chat bot (in XQuery) which gets its data by scraping various web pages, mainly Wikipedia pages so I'm delighted to discover this excellent resource and its SPARQL interface. One subject area is English Football clubs and a brief investigation shows up a few gaps in dbpedia caused by errors in the original Wikipedia pages. For example a count of teams in the Premier league: SELECT count(*) WHERE { ?team skos:subject . ?team dbpedia2:league :Premier_League. } shows only 18 when there are 20. The causes are 1) One team (Wigan) has the league as FA Premier League (the older name) 2) Another team (Manchester City) has the infobox wrongly labeled ( as Football club infobox ) Now 90% accuracy is good but not good enough, particularly if you are a Man City fan! I can fix both these at source and thus fix my chat application but I'd like to switch to dbpedia since I expect it to be faster so I'm wondering what the refresh cycle is or whether there is a repair mechanism in the dbpedia triple store.

DBpedia currently takes Wikipedia data as it is and does not try to resolve any inconsistencies. Therefore, you are getting the wrong result for your count query. Resolving inconsistiencies would require lots of manual (or semi-automatic) work and it is an open question whether this work should be done by correcting DBpedia data or, looking more promising to me, whether it would be better to currect inconsisitencies right within Wikipedia. We have lots of ideas for authoring tools that would support for Wikipedia authors by pointing them at inconsistencies and proposing ways to correct them, but we did not do any work into this direction yet as we are still looking for funding. The Dbpedia update cycle is currently 2 month and the next release of the dataset will be published in January. Cheers Chris uThanks Chris That's I thought and as you say, dbpedia makes a great tool for Wikipedians to find these discrepancies and correct them -I'll do what I can to tidy this subject area - do you have date when you will download ?

"Semantic GIS site based on dbpedia, freebase, openstreetmaps, etc."	"uHello, We just launched a new site at which is based on data from dbpedia and freebase and uses openstreetmaps for mapping. Behind it all is a 'semantic GIS' engine that combines the ability to represent traditional GIS with the ability to make assertions such as \"The Empire State Building is in Manhattan.\" A particularly remarkable feature is that very few of the images are geotagged: we're able to establish the locations of the photographs based on text and other available evidence. We've currently got an internal RDF vocabulary that does a good job of making assertions like \"Picture A is a picture of topic B\" \"Image C is an instance of Picture A\" \"Image C is 473 pixels high\" \"Image C is available at \" We're thinking a lot about how we're going to expose these assertions to the general public: we used SIOC for car pictures, but it doesn't seem to be all that useful for the major use case I'm thinking of: providing end users with the ability to query an endpoint for creative commons images about topic X and get back a list of images [in different sizes] with sufficient metadata to use usefully.

"Too many redirects?"	"uHi, I'm trying to set up some museum data, following best practice guidelines, with IIS 6 as the web server. Because IIS 6 doesn't have mod_rewrite support, I have taken the Smart 404 setup ( added support for filtering by Accept type. This all seems to work nicely: my base URLs such as: get 303'ed correctly to and depending on the Accept settings in the page header. So far, so good. The problem is that I then do a \"permanent\" re-direct of the mapped URL to an ASP which will actually deliver the required RTF, e.g.: &file;=WTcoll&index;=Identity%20number&key;=GRMDC.C104.6 When using tools such as the OpenLink RDF Browser, I only get sensible results if I enter this full form of URL: entering the \"resource\" URL doesn't work. Is it the case that I need to engineer my \"resource\" URLs so that they work without any redirection? (If so, they may need to become a bit less elegant ) Thanks, Richard uFurther to this, I have (on my son's advice) added an explicit \"RDF+XML\" Content-Type to the returned resource whenever this is specified in the Accept header in the request. This doesn't seem to help. I have also used 303 (SEEALSO) at each stage, rather than the hard-wired 301 (PERM) which I was using for the final stage. I've now realised that what I am seeing in the OpenLink RDF Browser is an RDF summary (of sorts) of the HTML page which you are sent to when you don't specify Accept: application/rdf+xml. Meanwhile, Disco just says \"No Information to Display\" unless I give it the final fully-converted URL. Which leads me to wonder whether these RDF browsers are setting the Accept header to \"application/rdf+xml\", when submitting an HTTP request for the resource whose URL you have typed in.

"How is the paper an interface, gateway, to the web of data?"	"uSePublica2012 an ESWC2012 Workshop. May 27-31, Heraklion, Greece. At Sepublica we want to explore the future of scholarly communication and scientific publishing. As we are going through a transition between print media and Web media, Sepublica aims to provide researchers with a venue in which this future can be shaped. Consider research publications: Data sets and code are essential elements of data intensive research, but these are absent when the research is recorded and preserved by way of a scholarly journal article. Or consider news reports: Governments increasingly make public sector information available on the Web, and reporters use it, but news reports very rarely contain fine-grained links to such data sources. At Sepublica we will discuss and present new ways of publishing, sharing, linking, and analyzing such scientific resources as well as reasoning over the data to discover new links and scientific insights. Workshop Format We are planning to have a full day workshop with two main sessions. During the first part of the workshop accepted papers will be presented; the second part of the workshop will address by means of focus groups two main questions, namely what do we want the future of scholarly communication to be? and how could data be preserved and delivered in an interactive manner over scholarly communications?. These focus groups will be followed by a panel discussion. As an outcome of these activities we will have a communique that will be the editorial for the workshop proceedings, Dates * workshop papers submission deadline: Feb 29 * workshop papers acceptance notification: April 1 * workshop papers camera ready: April 15 *Submission* Research papers are limited to 12 pages and position papers to 5 pages. For system/demo descriptions, a paper of minimum 2 pages, maximum 5 pages should be submitted. Late-breaking news should be one page maximum. All papers and system descriptions should be formatted according to the LNCS format . For submissions that are not in the LNCS PDF format, 400 words count as one page. Submissions that exceed the page limit will be rejected without review. Depending on the number and quality of submissions, authors might be invited to present their papers during a poster session. The author list does not need to be anonymized, as we do not have a double-blind review process in place. Submissions will be peer reviewed by three independent reviewers; late-breaking news get a light review w.r.t. their relevance by two reviewers. Accepted papers have to be presented at the workshop (requires registering for the ESWC conference and the workshop). Issues to be addressed - Representation: - Formal representations of scientific data; ontologies for scientific information - What ontologies do we need for representing structural elements in a document? - How can we capture the semantics of rhetorical structures in scholarly communication, and of hypotheses and scientific evidence? - Integration of quantitative and qualitative scientific information - How could RDF(a) and ontologies be used to represent the knowledge encoded in scientific documents and in general-interest media publications? - Connecting scientific publications with underlying research data sets - Technological Foundations: - Ontology-based visualization of scientific data - - Provenance, quality, privacy and trust of scientific information - Linked Data for dissemination and archiving of research results, for collaboration and research networks, and for research assessment - - How could we realize a paper with an API? How could we have a paper as a database, as a knowledge base? - How is the paper an interface, gateway, to the web of data? How could such and interface be delivered in a contextual manner? Applications and Use Cases: - Case studies on linked science, i.e., astronomy, biology, environmental and socio-economic impacts of global warming, statistics, environmental monitoring, cultural heritage, etc. - Barriers to the acceptance of linked science solutions and strategies to address these - Legal, ethical and economic aspects of Linked Data in science science"

I wish in the original RDF WG we'd used 'superProperty' and 'superClass' instead as the names for those relationships, then we could say 'Cat superClass Mammal. Mammal is superClass of Cat.', which would have worked fine. But back re your query: try reversing the variable names; when it tells you something 'is dbprop:exportGoods of', it means that there is some other object with an exportGoods property whose value is the current thing. Hope this helps, Dan uhi, this problem also occurs with the categories and skos:broader. all concepts are soley connected with broader - there's no such property like narrower - i thought it was done for saving triples, but you have to rewrite certain queries and sometimes formulate like check out consider the following when adjusting your query : - the underlying query of - if you see a isof the on a page the subject of that triple has changed. i.e. resource x broader x skos:broader y x skos:broader z is broader of a skos:broader x b skos:broader x wkr www.turnguard.com"

"DBpedia 3.7 dumps .nt file encoding issues"	"uHi, I get a couple of question related to the newest dumps as i published a howto for setting up a local DBpedia mirror quite some time ago on my blog.

"Geographical Coordinates"	"uHi all, I am beginning a mapping project that examines the geography of Wikipedia articles. To do this, I would like to start by looking at how many articles are tagged to each country of the world. I see that there geo-data are available ( there anyway to get these data so that I can construct a file organised by lat/long coordinates (that I could then import into a GIS)? Thanks in advance for the assistance, Mark uHi Mark, it shouldn't take much more than a few dozen lines of code to generate a file organised by lat/long (not sure what you mean by that) from the data in the geo_*.nt or geo_*.csv DBpedia files. For example, you could parse such a file and write its data into an SQL database. Or you could load the data into Virtuoso or another RDF store and use SPARQL queries. I'm afraid we don't have the data in any other format that might make your task easier.

Thanks, Mark uHi, I don't know where the number 65,456 comes from, but here are some thoughts: - the new DBpedia extraction (will be online in a few days) contains geo data extracted from 29,436 Portuguese Wikipedia atricles - about half of geonames' number. - DBpedia only extracts data from non-English articles that have an interwiki link to an English article, so we don't use e.g. but geonames does. - displays map entries for some places that don't have a Portuguese Wikipedia article, for example 65,456 probably includes data from other sources. Probably. has 30,156 entries, most of which seem to have geo data. That could mean half of all 65,456 Portuguese geonames entries are in France, and maybe a similar number for Portuguese DBpedia geo entries. Christopher"

"dbpedia + disambiguation pages"	"uChris, Since your question is quite specific to DBpedia, let's continue the discussion at the DBpedia mailing list (see #support and CC). Please consider remove from the CC list for further replies. On 4 Aug 2007, at 20:18, Chris Richard wrote: No, we currently don't do any special processing for Wikipedia's disambiguation pages. The main focus of DBpedia is extraction of information about the *things* described in Wikipedia articles, to enable domain queries over this information. Disambiguation information isn't really about those things, it's about the names we use to refer to those things. (Specifically, when a single name could refer to more than one of those things.) So it's more linguistic in nature, and hasn't registered prominently on our priority list. I think that a large part of the disambiguation information could be captured using relatively simple heuristics. There's no need to capture everything, 80% might be good enough. The DBpedia codebase has pluggable Extractors that produce RDF triples from an article's source code; this would be yet another extractor. I don't know how to represent this in RDF. DBpedia defines one resource from each Wikipedia article, assuming that the topic of each article is some meaningful entity in the real world. This certainly doesn't hold for disambiguation pages, whose topic is not a single thing, but a multitude of things that happen to be related to some name, word, or term. Can you give us some examples where you think this information could be used? The next update will include dbpedia:redirectsTo triples for redirected articles. Note that redirects are often not synonyms, but artifacts of Wikipedia's evolution. Redirects contain things like misspelled names, names that adhere to older naming conventions (e.g. the original WikiWords CamelCase naming convention), instances where multiple articles were folded into one etc. Thus they make poor labels. Cheers, Richard uI would like to follow up on a point raised by Chris Richard and discussed by Richard Cyganiak on 2007-08-05; namely - how should Dbpedia deal with disambiguation pages? Recall that Wikipedia uses disambiguation pages to allow users to navigate from ambigous query terms (like en \"bank\") to the appropriate article e.g. concerning financial instutions, river parts, sea beds or whatever. Usually the first link on the disambiguation page is to what is thought to be the most common sense of the term. In Dbpedia disambiguation pages are treated like any other article. For the \"bank\" disambiguation page, the article-label triple is: \"Bank (disambiguation)\"@en . The links to the appropriate articles (senses of \"bank\") in the Wikipedia disambiguation page are available as Dbpedia pagelinks e.g. # financial institution . # sea floor . I am interested in using DBpedia in applications which analyse text and try to identify which concepts are referenced. Suppose I have a sentence which contains the word \"bank\" and that I have identified it as a noun. I want to be able to look up \"bank\" in Dbpedia and find all the things this might mean; later on in the analysis I'll try to eliminate senses of \"bank\" that are inappropriate in the context. This is a classic scenario in language engineering and I am sure I am not alone in considering the use of Dbpedia for this sort of thing. However, the only resource in DBpedia that has the label \"bank\" is the financial institution . To find other resources that can be referred to as \"bank\" I would have to do special processing (e.g somehow transforming \"bank\" into \"Bank (Disambiguation)\" and then following through pagelinks to the different articles). Rather than sorting this out in my own corner, I would much prefer that something be done about this in the Dbpedia deliverables One option might be to follow the disamb page links and add the ambiguous label to each of the referenced articles. So, for example, we would add a label \"Bank\" to the resource already labelled \"Bank (sea floor)\", and so on. This added label should be distinguished in some way e.g. perhaps with skos:altLabel. \"Bank (sea floor)\"@en . \"Bank\"@en . This approach does not tell us which was the first resource mentioned on the disambiguation page. But I believe that in general it is this item which has the amiguous term as its label eg the first item on the bank disambiguation page is the financial institution sense which is labelled \"Bank\". An application using Dbpedia would just follow rdfs:label (rather than skos:altLabel) to find what Wikipedians consider to be the Ur-sense of the term. For existing users of Dbpedia there would be no change: the current labels would continue to work exactly as before. Any solution to disambiguation also needs to be compatible with a solution to redirects (which I believe is on the Dbpedia task list). In the pagelinks, it would be nice to distinguish the links from disambiguation pages from other more innocent wikilinks. Or perhaps explicity flag resources representing disambiguation pages in some way. As you may suspect, I would be pretty happy if Wiktionary was also available in RDF and it had systematic links from senses to Dbpedia resources. But I don't suppose that is going to happen this week Lee Humphreys - SPSS - Paris DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN\" dbpedia + disambiguation pages uLee, Thanks for the thoughtful post, and I fully agree with your analysis. Note that finding the links from or to is easy, a special template is used throughout Wikipedia to create these links. Finding all the senses of an ambiguous term requires heuristics, but looks doable. The only thing we need is someone who implements this. Trying to be realistic, I think the core team is not likely to quickly run out of higher-priority tasks, so the best hope of getting this done soon is through an external contribution.

Please give us some input if you can answer these questions: I am trying text search in virtuos from isql against a locally loaded dbpedia. *QUESTION ONE* Why does bif:contains return faster than REGEX search, and why are they returning a different number of counted rows?

The indexes are based on the \"Literal Objects\" in Triples. Regex isn't based on the Full Text indexes. uHello Marvin, bif:contains return faster because it uses special full-text index to get IDs of objects that contain words mentioned in the query, it do not scan the whole table like Regex-based query. The advantage of REGEX is flexibility: one may search for specific fragments of words or for special data like protein coding sequences. Moreover, bif:contains may be used only for variables that are directly bound in object position of triple, not for values of expressions of any other sorts. Because bif:contains looks for phrases or independent words, and it may normalize words that use non-canonical Unicode chars, and it can search in XML/HTML documents. In addition, even if one and the same query string is valid for both REGEX and bif:contains then the meaning may differ. For REGEX, pattern \"Paris Hilton\" is precisely two words delimited by single whitespace byte. For bif:contains, \"Paris Hilton\" means that the document should contain word \"Paris\" and word \"Hilton\", in any places and in any order. See for details of bif:contains query string syntax. question. Which should we use?

"ImageExtractor config"	"uHi all, I am trying to undestand the configuration of the ImageExtractor.

This is the reason the English Wikipedia has only one template for non-free licence ({{non-free}}) while other languages like Greek do not. In Greek we have a seratate template for every licence, so we had to manually find which ones are \"non-free\".

Also, I'm glossing over a lot of the details. The images (and other media: video, audio) are separate files: they are not part of the database dumps. All of the text in each wikipedia can be reasonably expected to be free, and can be considered to be a single work. Each image (etc.) is an individual work, and can carry its own licensing terms. Usually, these are similar in spirit to cc-by-sa, or less restrictive. Some wikipedias will tolerate (i.e., they are discouraged, but permitted) non-free images (and some don't - the Polish Wikipedia does not allow any non-free images). In the case of the English Wikipedia, most of these are low-resolution reproductions of 'important' images, and are flagged as being used under the 'fair use' doctrine. A complication here is public domain images, because what is and isn't in the public domain varies greatly from territory to territory. Something published before 1923 will typically be in the public domain in the US, but may not be anywhere else. The Wikimedia Foundation is based in the US, as are the Wikipedia servers, so to a greater or lesser extent, US law applies to all wikipedias (there may be local wikimedia foundations that correspond to a particular language's edition of wikipedia, which adopt a set of rules more appropriate to their location, but the servers are still in the US). uis that the reason for all broken image links? for example dbpedia:SomeResource foaf:depiction . most values for foaf:depiction are different from the real values at wikipediathe differences appear at commons/langtag and N assuming other numeric valuesdbpedia values for depiction are returning 404 Cheers, Mauricio On 1/24/12, Dimitris Kontokostas < > wrote: uOn 01/24/2012 07:23 PM, Jimmy O'Regan wrote: Does it mean that a link towards a copyrighted data is not copyrighted ?

"DBpedia categories; URL shortening"	"uHi Kingsley! The problem is: 1. How to KNOW which categories represent types. There are 5-10 approaches for this, based on NLP and ML. E.g.

A lot of them tie up into Wordnet, some into OpenCyc/UMBEL. It's a hard research problem. 2. How to KNOW which category-entity instance is an exception. E.g. a category \"Books of Author Xyz\" is typically applied to the page \"Author Xyz\" and a naïve interpretation will conclude that the author is a book.

Of course we do not plan to keep the mappings in isolation from the ontology, there should always be a feedback loop. The problem we had so far was that the mappings drove the ontology design and if someone couldn't easily find a dbo property/class to map an infobox she created a new one. What we want now is the exact opposite, the ontology design should come first. What we did not yet announce is that we are already building some tools that will ease the feedback from the ontology to the mappings wiki and hopefully overall improve the data quality of DBpedia.

As you might know, together with Magnus we have already invested some thoughts (and publications) into the topic with the focus on data cleansing based on an improved DBpedia ontology.[1,2] Unfortunately, Magnus and I will not be able to participate live at the Dublin Meeting in Feb 9. Nevertheless, we would like to contribute. From our perspective we would like to apply the DBpedia ontology to detect inconsistencies and flaws in DBpedia facts. This should not only be possible in a retroactive way, but should take place much earlier. Besides the detection of inconsistencies during the mapping process or afterwards in the extracted data, this could already be possible right from the start when the user is changing the wikipedia infobox content (in the sense of type checking for domain/range, checking of class disjointness and further constraints, plausibility check for dates in connection with basic axioms to be defined, etc.). Another possibility would be a tool that makes inconsistencies/flaws in wikipedia data visible directly in the wikipedia interface, where users could either correct them or confirm facts that are originally in doubt. To achieve this, not only a formally sound and semantically enrichedDBpedia ontology including a set of basic axioms would be necessary, but also the applications and infrastructure that make use of the ontology. Also the relation of the DBpedia ontology to other ontologies would be a rather interesting topic. This includes the already proposed schemata (schema.org, facebook OG, etc) as well as established ontologies (yago, umbel, etc) where mapping to DBpedia entities already exist. Can we make use of these ontologies (and existing mappings) to complement DBpedia ontology in som (semi-)automated way? Thanks and best regards, Harald [1] G. Töpper, M. Knuth, and H.

Ontology Problems Almost all of these are also reported in the two trackers described in sec.2 Sounds very interesting! I've been quite active in the last couple of months, but I've been pecking at random here and there. More systematic approaches are definitely needed, as soon as they are not limited to a theoretical experiment, or a one-time effort that's quickly closed down. I've observed many error patterns, and if people smarter than me can devise ways to leverage and amplify these observations using algorithmic or ML approaches, that could create fast progress. I give some examples of the \"Need for Research\" of specific problems: and next section. Sounds very promising! If I can help somehow with \"manual ontological & wiki labor\", let me know. Data vs ontology validation can provide - mapping defect lists - useful hints that the Extraction can use. The most important feature would be Use Domain & Range to Guide Extraction I'm doubtful of the utility of \"error lists\" to Wikipedia (or it needs to be done with skill and tact): 1. The mapping wiki adopts an Object vs DataProp Dichotomy (uses owl:ObjectProperty and owl:DatatypeProperty and never rdf:Property). But MANY Wikipedia fields include both links and text, and in many cases BOTH are useful 2. At the end of the day, Wikipedia is highly-crafted text, so telling Wikipedia editors that they can't write something, will not sit well with them. For example, who should resolve this contradiction: DBO: dbo:parent rdfs:range dbo:Person Wikipedia: | mother = [[Queen Victoria]] of [[England]] I think the Extraction Framework (by filtering out the link that is not Person), not Wikipedians But Wikipedia is moving towards using Wikidata props in template fields: through {{#property}}. Cheers! uVladimir, I am more than happy to work the ML problem with you. For your example of the dichotomy with the domain and range of \"mother\" and queen Victoria being the \"mother\", this begs for contextual approach to that concept Aaron u uI could ask you a converse question: how can you make an accurate ontology without looking at the data? And to look at the data, you need mappings (if not to execute then to document what you've examined). But more constructively: There is a large number of mapping problems independent of the ontology. E.g. when a Singer (Person) is mapped to Band (Organisation) due to wrong check of a field \"background\", I donât care how the classes are organized, I already hurt that the direct type is wrong. Of course, having a good ontology would help! E.g. some guy named Admin made in 2010 two props \"occupation\" and \"personFunction\" with nearly identical role & history. - No documentation of course. - occupation has 100-250 uses, personFunction has 20-50 uses. - Which of the two to use? - More importantly, which have already been used right, and which are wrong? I suspect that most uses of occupation are as a DataProp, even though it's declared as an ObjectProp. DBpedia adopts an Object/DataProp Dichotomy that IMHO does not work well. See dbpedia-problems-long.html#sec-3-2 uHi Aaron! Would be great to work with someone from Cray but I don't have a good idea how to use ML here, nor indeed a lot of trust in using ML to produce or fix mappings. E.g. see this exchange: Generating 30% wrong prop maps for the Ukrainian dbpedia is IMHO doing them a disservice! Who's gonna clean up all this? I guess I'm more of a MLab (Manual Labor) guy, I just learned they coined such alias for crowdsourcing: She IS the mother, not sure what you mean. Here a simple post-extraction cleanup can take care of it: remove all statements that violate range (so dbo:parent [[England]] will be removed). But we dare not do it, because many of the ranges are imprecise, or set wishfully without regard to existing data / mappings. (As usual, the real data is more complex than any model of it.) So we need to check our Ontological Assumptions and precise domains/ranges before such cleanup. See example in dbpedia-problems-long.html#sec-6-7 uVladimir, I'm thinking of trying to do some stats on the existing ontology and the mappings to see where there is room for improvement. I'm tied up this week with a couple deadlines that I seem to moving towards at greater than light speed, though my progress is not. As soon as I get the rough cut done, I'll share the results with you and maybe we can discuss paths forward? I'm with you on the 30% error ratethat doesn't help anyone.

I'm not necessarily opposed to that notion, by want to make sure that we are all in agreement as to the scope of work, as it were. What would be the implications of a complete redo? Would the benefit outweigh the impact to the community? I would assume that there would be a ripple effect across all other LOD datasets that map to dbpedia, correct? Or am I grossly overstating/misunderstanding how interconnected the ontology is? Vladimir, your thoughts? Aaron uHi John, My thoughts are for DBpedia to stay close to the mission of extracting quality data from Wikipedia, and no more. That quality extraction is an essential grease to the linked data ecosystem, and of much major benefit to anyone needful of broadly useful structured data. I think both Wikipedia and DBpedia have shown that crowdsourced entity information and data works beautifully, but the ontologies or knowledge graphs (category structures) that emerge from these effort are mush. DBpedia, or schema.org from that standpoint, should not be concerned so much about coherent schema, computable knowledge graphs, ontological defensibility, or any such T-Box considerations. They have demonstrably shown themselves to not be strong in these suits. No one hears the term \"folksonomy\" any more because all initial admirers have seen no crowd-sourced schema to really work (from dmoz to Freebase). A schema is not something to be universally consented, but a framework by which to understand a given domain. Yet the conundrum is, to organize anything globally, some form of conceptual agreement about a top-level schema is required. Look to what DBpedia now does strongly: extract vetted structured data from Wikipedia for broader consumption on the Web of data. My counsel is to not let DBpedia's mission stray into questions of conceptual \"truth\". Keep the ontology flat and simple with no aspirations other than \"just the facts, ma'am\". Thanks, Mike On 2/25/2015 10:33 PM, M. Aaron Bossert wrote: uThe one thing I would say is that while I agree in generalthe one thing that keeps eating away at me is that there is tremendous potential in dbpedia for bigger questions to be answered, but the more advanced analytics require that some level of sanity exists within the ontologymuch more so than now. As an example, I have created several different applications for customers that are based on dbpediaone of which is a recommender system. The level of effort required to simply say (in SPARQL, of course) \"show me every living person that is highly similar to person X, excluding politicians athletes and actors\" is quite a tedious thing to do until after I have \"fixed\" all the erroneous and missing properties associated with \"things\" in generalwhich person class do I focus on? Which living people? Which politicians? Perhaps legislators? It gets pretty ugly, pretty quickly. I'm not sure that the ontology needs to be completely rewritten, but surely it can't be that difficult to clean up a bit with a little common sense logic applied such as if a \"thing\" has a death date (never mind which one), then surely they are not a living personor if they hold a political office, surely they must be a politician. Aaron uI agree with Aaron and this the reason we started this effort. Even a small improvement in quality through the ontology could have a big impact. Improving the ontology should be an iterative process that will take into account both the data and the mappings. However, some decisions/actions can be made independent of the data or the mappings @John Flynn, all the issues you mention are valid and we are working on a more formal description of the requirements that will cover at least some of them @Mike Bergman, I think everyone agrees that strict schemas do not work well in crouwdsourced data and we need to define some trade-offs @all, looks like this thread got too big and too focused on DBpedia.

Consider the following url: Demo: Find me 100 example concepts in the DBPedia dataset. As a demonstration this uses the qtxt parameter to fill in the fields on the form so you can see what is going on. When you press the \"Run Query\" button, it will give you a table. If you look at the addressbar of your browser you will see that the &qtxt; has been replaced by &query; which triggers the /sparql endpoint to automatically execute the query. By setting the Format selector from HTML to Json or RDF/XML you can change the way the result set of your query is returned. Again after you have pressed the \"Run Query\" button, you can see how changes to the form change the &format; field in the addressbar. See above. I am seeing plenty of Google links that maybe of interest but you can start with: [1] [2] [3] Hope this helps Patrick uHi Patrick Thank you so much for your email!

I'm making something simple that, given a person, looks up creative works they are responsible for, looks up the dates of those creative works, then subtracts the birth date of those to get the age at which they created something and then makes a report. When I GET the prolific character designer I can find the games she did art for by following the backward dbo:gameArtist links to the games she designed, which are returned by the GET request. Then I can GET the games, but when I do so, the release dates are often incorrect, for instance has a release date back in the 1930's, which of course predates Tsunako and is invalid. The root cause is that there is an awful blob in the infobox that contains multiple release dates in various geographic regions. In my case, the standard of quality is that I want the earliest release date but I'm not too excited if I am off by Â±1 year. (She might have done the illustrations in the prior year, etc.) The above one is obviously absurd and easy to catch, but exhibits a much more insidious error where it gets the 2015 release date of the Windows edition of a remade and heavily modified version (different combat system, different world travel, new voice acting, new music, ) which might pass by you if you're not the kind of person who drinks Nep Bull. Interstingly, Wikidata gets the release date right (by my definition) and claims it got it from Wikipedia. It's a run-of-the-mill kind of quality problem that affects users, but it gets into all the questions of \"what exactly do you want to model?\" as clearly the Wikipedia editors are trying to model it at a very fine grain but users might want a spectrum of different granularities. uThanks for the report Paul, These kind of cases are haunting us since the beginning of DBpedia. There are two cases here 1) flexibility of the mappings wiki to define fine grained extraction rules 2) representation uniformity of the data in Wikipedia for parsing them correctly For (1) we are working with Gent University on moving the mappings to RML which will give us great flexibility Fixing (1) will not help us much with (2) though since Wikipedia users might not put the right data in the right place and proper format for (2) we are working on fixing this problem by integrating data from multiple sources (inc Wikidata) and trying to resolve conflicts etc wrt Wikidata, the fact that Wikidata has this right and the value is taken from WIkipedia can have different interpretations. It could have been entered manually or there is a video game bot that is tweaked to parse these \"awful blobs\".

"User contributed data to DBpedia, was: Add your links to DBpedia workflow version"	"uHi Søren, (I renamed the topic and replaced DBpedia developers list with discussion) in general, we would like to improve nothing in DBpedia, whcih should be fixed in Wikipedia. So population numbers should be fixed there (or WikiData soon hopefully). We really do not want to become something like Freebase, as DBpedia should stay a Semantic Web mirror of Wikipedia. By the way, wouldn't it be sufficient to link to EuroStats? On the other hand, it might make sense to create additional structures over DBpedia identifiers. Yago, umbel and schema.org already does this and provides their hierarchy for DBpedia to include. This should, however, not overlap with the DBpedia ontology. There are also plans to extend the Mappings Wiki, so everybody can customize mappings for personal use cases. This is not an easy topic however."

"object property extractor should checkÂ Â Â Â rdfs:range"	"uHi Vladimir, the lack of constraint enforcing in the DBpedia dataset was something I discovered some time ago. Still there are several reasons for that, I guess: 1. As Pablo Mendes explained in some past discussion - you can treat the property constraints not as real constraints, but just additional data points. That's why they are not enforced, since this would cause much data to be lost, but usually more data is better (at least in a statistics-based approach). 2. The second reason is that many of the DBpedia resources don't have any type assigned. So these data would be lost as well, even though most of them is valid. 3. If you only need data that is compatible with the constraints, you can enforce that on your own. Cheers, Aleksander uIMHO low quality data is never better. Don't know what you mean by \"statistics-based approach\", but if you mean Machine Learning, bad data is disastrous to learn from. Not always. If bad data is statistically negligible it doesn't make too much harm. On the other hand - in logic-based approach - bad data makes much more harm. By statistics-based approach I mean whatever method that bases inferences on counting of events. By logic-based approach I mean methods that does not take counting into account. If there is only one invalid assertion in 10.000 a statistics-based method will just ignore it, but logic-based method will draw false conclusions. I disagree that data quality should be left to a \"do it yourself\" approach. Well, it depends on the POV. As a data consumer you might be interested in the data with the best quality, but as a producer, you might be interested in providing more data, that the consumers will take care of. Cf. DBpedia approach towards properties. At the beginning it included data that was directly extracted from the infoboxes. At present these data are supplemented with data obtained via property mapping. But the original data extracted without mapping are still available. Since DBpedia is a community effort, you should not expect that everything will be perfect, since there is usually a shortage of human resources to implement all the great ideas. That's why DIY might be the only available option. Do you have specific objections to the DBO ontology? I have some, mostly related to redundant/non-orthogonal properties. But I donât see serious defects in the class hierarchy. Well, I haven't made any in-depth study regarding the class hierarchy, but I doubt building a general purpose ontology might be done this way. Moreover there are other ontologies: Dolce, Sumo, Cyc, BFO, etc. that are better suited for this task. Regarding specific issues - e.g. the lack of is-a/genls distinction in type assignment, mixing of roles with semantic/ontological categories, lack of coverage in a number of topics, lack of higher order concepts, to name just a few. Most of the classes lack NL definitions, which makes everything even harder. I'm not going into properties, since this is a mess. Data should not just be thrown away: the extractor should also make a list of exceptions, to be given back to the: - DBpedia Mapping community - Wikipedia editorial communities Well, that would be great, but I guess there are not enough human resources to implement these ideas."

"GSoC 2016: Inferring Infobox Template Class Mappings From Wikipedia and WikiData"	"u*Mentor: Nilesh ChakrabortyStudent: Peng Xu* In the first phase of the project, I complete a approach to find new mappings for languages with few existing mappings based on languages with enough mappings and cross-language links. This approach can achieve fairly good evaluation results. And I get 456 high-quality new mappings for Chinese after my manual check. Due to the incomplete coverage of mapping on DBpedia, we need to predict ontology types for instances without a type. In the second phase, I try different methods including tensor factorization and graph embeddings on DBpedia to do type prediction. The experiments show that tensor factorization can achieve good performance on small languages like Bulgarian. However, for larger languages it performs badly due to the limit of memory. All the scripts I wrote can be easily applied to other languages if datasets are downloaded to the proper path. All my code and detailed documents can be found here: Further work: Currently, I ignore the literals in DBpedia when doing tensor factorization. The next step is to add the literal information. Furthermore, considering the issues about time and memory complexity, a distributed implementation of the algorithm can be useful if we want to apply the ideas on languages like English. Best Regards Peng Xu uGreat work Peng Xu & Nilesh! @everyone, the Chinese results look quite good, the ones with the English names at least, I couldn't tell the rest :) We want to apply this to other languages with low on no mappings at all but we need native speakers for the evaluation Any volunteers?

"Fact ranking game (creation of ground truth)"	"u[Apologies for cross-posting. Please redistribute within your own group or among colleagues, thank you!] In recent years we have experienced an exponential increase of knowledge available on the web. Having such an extensive amount of information poses a challenge when trying to identify globally relevant or important facts. In effort to address this issue, several fact ranking systems have already been developed. However, the difficulty with current state-of-the-art systems is that there is no gold standard corpus which could serve as a ground truth for evaluating their performances. We have developed a fun and exciting quiz which will help us to tackle this issue by using the wisdom of the crowd. While you are playing, your inputs (which are greatly appreciated) will contribute to our scientific experiment. Together, we will build a first corpus that will help our scientific community in evaluating different fact ranking strategies! Here you will find our tool that is used to rank facts about ~500 popular entities from Wikipedia. You have to register with the tool and then the task will be explained to you in detail. You might interrupt your rating of the presented facts any time you like and continue later. To make it a bit more interesting, you will be able to score points and see your ranking in a highscore list. We would really appreciate your help in this task. Please do also spread the word.

If the mappings look OK I might be soon releasing an NT file that specifies rdf:type between dbpedia resources and Fbase types.

"instance_types and infoboxes"	"uHi, thanks for helping me with my previous question. I do now understand that the classification of persons in the instance_types file is done by using the infobox type. So for example all persons with an infobox of the type \"writer\" are classified as writers. Oddly there are many persons classified as writers whose articles don't contain infoboxes at all. A few examples: - Richard Zenith - Carolyn Graham - Alvilde Prydz - N. J. Crisp How come instance_types tagges them as writers? Is there another way for classification than using the infobox type? Thanks again, Christoph uHi Christoph, that is correct but it is not the complete truth. The classification is done based on Wikipedia templates (infoboxes are a special type of template) that are used in the article of the person. There is no restriction of the template types to visible infoboxes. This Wikipedia article contains a template called US-writer-stub which is mapped in DBpedia to the class Writer, see [1]. The other instances you mention seem to have stub templates assigned, too. Thus, to more precisely see where a certain instance type is coming from, you have to look at the source code for all templates used in the article and see if some of these templates are mapped in the mappings wiki. Cheers, Daniel [1] uAlso: as Volha explained on 12/9/2014 12:02 PM, there is a file \"mapping-based-types-heuristic\": See sample at And on 12/11/2014 2:59 PM I gave an example that the extractor can make \"stub resources\" even when there's no wiki page, but the person is mentioned in an appropriate list.

By this I mean: the better results at top, and the worse (the longer slide) at the bottom. It will be even better, and will gives some sense of \"grading\" to the graph from top to bottom. Could deserves a test; dunno. Take care, Fred uHi Georgi, I know - unfortunately, I have extremely limited time to do this at the moment. It's very unfair to leave it as it is, but I have no choice. Andy suggested a RAM upgrade in part, which definitely makes sense, but would require me to re-run all the tests. I see this happening for future tests. I would love to optimize the databases, but optimizing MySQL is a science of its own, and I don't have much experience with PostgreSQL. If a PostgreSQL ANALYZE is all it takes, I will do that - but I'm sure there are other parameters. If you come up with an optimized configuration, I'd be happy to implement it. Alternatively, I could also give you ssh access. That's why I always restart the server for each run, and have a fixed order of running the queries. I do this at least twice (although I only take the first result), and my results have been very consistent so far. I'm not sure about the indices on the DBpedia endpoint, but my guess is that they don't have the optimized indexing configuration. Without optimizations, query 3 took 112 seconds on my machine. Also note that I don't have all DBpedia sets loaded, and I don't know what else runs on the public endpoint. Thanks, Christian uGeorgi Kobilarov wrote: Georgi, Do you see the missing indexes as a special optimization? As I said, we are guilty of not documenting index usage scenarios with the kind of clarity required by time challenged evaluators etc. Of course, if there are are optimizations that others have we put them all in the pot and re-run. I would like to believe that Christian's benchmarks factor this in. But I'll leave this to Christian to confirm. Christian: Why not publish the actual benchmark program source code? This is what we do with all our benchmarks. Even better, if you are interested, we can provide a mechanism for you to add this to our Open Source Benchmark Tool [1]. I don't think Christian is trying to imply that you can run a live instance of DBpedia on I gig of RAM setup (amongst other things). This is exactly why I made my comments about a scalability variant of the benchmarks. Also, it would be nice if there were many DBpedia mirrors, this would enable a variety of scalability benchmarks based on real world usage scenarios (the thing we spend most of our time working on). Thus, it would be nice if you guys could bring an ARQ based DBpedia instance on line, especially as this would offer dual benefits beyond benchmarking RDF Store scalability. Links: 1.

Since Barack_Obama is a rather prominent entry (so one would assume that errors in Wikipedia or dbpedia should get caught quickly), I am worried about the information that may be in there for less prominent entries. Many thanks, Â  Johann uHi Johann, If you look into the source code of the pages, for instance, the Russian one for Obama, you find out that the list of Obama's book is defined with \"ÐºÐ½Ð¸Ð³Ð°\" template (the translation is \"book\") - search for \"{{ÐºÐ½Ð¸Ð³Ð°\" in the source code. And - guess what - there is a mapping for the infobox with the same name, to the Book class of the DBpedia ontology The extraction framework just doesn't know which one of the infoboxes on the page is \"the main one\" - there actually seems to be no standard way to specify this in the Wiki page code. Some heuristics can be used - roughly, finding anything starting with \"{{\" and trying to treat is as a source of the DBpedia type - and this is exactly how you get the strange types. Cheers, Volha uHi Volha, thank you for this explanation! I can now understand why this happened, but I am still hoping that there might be some way of fixing this, because it seems to add considerable noise (isa book and isa person should actually be mutually disjoint and then any ontology containing both facts would be inconsistent). What I also found is that although the downloaded files for the German dbpedia do contain Angela Merkel being a quote, the online version does not show this type for Angela Merkel. So it appears that at least in the online German version, there has been a way to clean this or avoid this? Strictly speaking, all facts from all languages for the same entity (URI) should be consistent, and given the OWA, combinging the facts from multiple languages should improve the KB, so some heuristic way of choosing between the types implied by multiple templates may be a better solution? Is it ever possible for the types inferred from multiple templates to be compatible and correct? My initial assumption would be that templates like \"book\" or \"quote\" in these cases always appear after the main template in the article? What I find particularly worrying about this errors is that they occur for rather important entities, so anyone looking up Angela Merkel in an ontology derived from these files will find that she is-a quote BTW, I had a look at the DBpedia ontology and it seems there are a number of disjointWith axioms in there e.g. person is disjoint with building and with escalator, but book is not defined to be disjoint with anything, it appears. Having such definitions (or simply descriptive object properties which define which types are incompatible without actually causing inconsistency) may help to detect such problems in the first place?

"Constructing the right SPARQL query"	"uHello everyone. I am looking into getting the list of the most influential people in history.

I think that captures *influencer: influencee (Aristotle : Alexander, Aristotle : Myself)*, which means, in this scenario, Aristotle (the node), has an in-degree of 2. I thought in-degree was a measure of influence rather than an outdegree. Remember, this is going to be plotted as a *directed* graph in Gephi. I'll be curious to know how I'll actually distinguish in-degrees and out-degrees in Gephi practicaly, but anyway. Moreover, I didn't quite get about how I could do a Page-Rank style style aggregation on this specific scenario. Could you please provide some examples using actual person names so I can digest it well in my head. Thanks for getting my head working though, but I still believe the Wikipedia data gives you a decent impression of influence to an extent, albeit not the most accurate, but it kind of appears to be right in one way or the other.

You can't do PageRank from just the counts. You need the full network of links. As an example, if Marx had the most direct influencees, but Aristotle influenced Marx, shouldn't that count for something? Perhaps more? BTW, Freebase actually thinks Nietzsche is first by simple count, not Marx, but the underlying data is so biased and incomplete for both Wikipedia & Freebase, that I'm not sure it's worth pursuing a more sophisticated weighting. Tom p.s. If you're using Gephi, it has a PageRank implementation u1. Right, it depends on exactly that, the direction of the edges. At the moment, my query returns influencer: influencee, so that clearly means if the edges run towards the first column in the table, which is influencer. Am I right? 2. I know we can't do PR from counts. I didn't mean that at all. You are right, that factor does mean a lot (Aristotle influenced Marx), and there can be even more complicated analysis done, but at this stage, I am just getting the feel for the data. Thanks to you, new ideas like PR have popped up which I aim to utilize through Gephi. Moreover, how since you mentioned Freebase, I'd like to ask you if you know how can I use the influence node to do the same query that I am doing here on DBPedia. I gave up because I couldn't get it to work and moreover it returns JSON so I thought I will have problems doing a UNION of DBPedia with Freebase results. If you can give me some insight into this, I'd be able to perform my analysis with more data. Duplication won't be an issue due to the SQL query handling that, it will still give me some more data which is good. Thanks Tom. On Sat, Dec 21, 2013 at 8:09 PM, Tom Morris < > wrote:"

My understanding is that Freebase uses Wikipedia data and WEX; they've certainly extracted a list of topics from wikipedia. They're based in the US so they can probably claim they're under the US jurisidiction. I've got no idea what that means for international uses of Freebase. Although I personally benefit from the lassez-faire situation in the US, I'm wondering if the stronger db copyright laws in the EU are more reflective of current realities. If I were going to, say, compile a list of US presidents and their birth dates, I could certainly use a manual process to copy these out of the Encyclopedia Britannica. You can't say a fact like dbpedia:Abraham_Lincoln someschema:bornOn \"February 12, 1809\" . belongs to anybody.

On Thu, 21 May 2009, Chris Bizer wrote: The Feist case in the USA shows that you can copy a telephone book without getting into problem with the copyright. The individual fact can probably not copyrightable if they are sufficiently short. I think that 250 works would be long enough to have copyright on its own: The phrase \"E.T. Phone Home\" was copyrightable in the USA - if I remember correctly. The copyright law for Wikipedia and DBpedia as a collection is different between USA and countries of the European Union, due to the EU Database Directive of 1996. A collection of fact and data may be protected in the EU, regardless of whether the individual data items are copyrightable or not. That means that you cannot copy a 'substantial part' of a database if the database constitutes a 'substantial investment'. It is possible (in my opinion quite) that the set of Wikipedia templates constitute a database, so that the authors (collectively?) has database right. So perhaps European Wikipedia authors can claim database right against the European(?) DBpedia. But the situation is very hazy due to the international nature of Wikipedia/DBpedia and its authors and re-users. Wikipedia is in USA so perhaps the European Directive does not reach there even thought authors and database copier are European I guess the DBpedia cannot claim (European database) copyright, because DBpedia does not 'construct' the data: This is what the Wikipedia authors do. In a Danish court case (Ofir v. Home) the company Home lost its database right to the Ofir search engine because Home did not construct the data itself - that was done by Home's franchise takers. Somewhat similarly was the 'Hill case' in the European Court. My guess is that the 'safest' for DBpedia would be to honor Wikipedia authors database rights and just re-distribute the data under the same license that Wikipedia uses. I am not a lawyer. I have just recently looked into the issue due to my own database-like wiki. And I must say I find the situation very hazy. Maybe constructive examples of the use of database right, such as a copylefted DBpedia could help pave the way for a global clarification. /Finn Finn Aarup Nielsen, DTU Informatics, Denmark Lundbeck Foundation Center for Integrated Molecular Brain Imaging"

Could someone briefly explain the nature of the Pagelinks dataset and the differences with the Wikipedia? Thank you for your time, Dario. uHi Dario, the dataset you are using is extracted by the org.dbpedia.extraction.mappings.PageLinksExtractor [1]. This extractor collects internal wiki links [2] from Wikipedia content articles (that is, wikipedia pages which belong to the Main namespace [3]) to other wikipedia pages (please note I am not talking about content articles here, because also links to pages in the File or Category namespaces are collected). Each row - triple - in the Pagelinks represent a directed link between two pages, e.g. . means that an internal link to found in You can check this link exists here (first sentence) [6] Basically this can be modeled in a directed graph as an edge \"Albedo -> Latin\" The reason why you have 17M instances (I suppose you are counting the nodes in your graph) is because objects in each triple can be outside the Main namespace. As far as I remember, 4M articles are wiki pages with belong to the Main namespace and which are neither redirects [4] nor disambiguation pages [5]. Hope this clarifies a bit :-) Cheers Andrea [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 2013/12/2 Dario Garcia Gasulla < > uIn addition to Adrea's reply, we also collect the \"red links\" which means links to pages that do not exist (yet).

At the moment we are not dealing with the {{cite}} template nor {{cite book}} etc. We are looking into extensions which could support similar use cases anyway.

Do you refer to HTML dumps of the whole wikipedia? Cheers Andrea [1] 2013/12/3 Tom Morris < > uI think I could get this data out of some API, but there are great HTML 5 parsing libraries now, so a link extractor from HTML can be built as quickly than an API client. There are two big advantages of looking at links in HTML: (i) you can use the same software to analyze multiple sites, and (ii) the HTML output is often the most tested output of a system. This is particularly a problem in the case of Wikipedia markup which has no formal specification and for which the editors aren't concerned if the markup is clean but they will fix problems if they cause the HTML to look wrong. Another advantage of HTML is that you can work from a static dump file, or run a web crawler against the real Wikipedia or against a local copy of Wikipedia loaded from the database dump files.

Andrea u@Andrea, there are old static dumps available, but I can say that running the web crawler is not at all difficult. I got a list of topics by looking at the ?s for DBpedia descriptions and then wrote a very simple single-threaded crawler that took a few days to run on a micro instance in AWS. The main key to writing a successful web crawler is keeping it simple.

This is a problem for a project like DBpedia, as you can easily understand. Moreover, I did not mean that it is not possible to crawl Wikipedia instances or load dump into a private Mediawiki instance (the latter is what happens when abstracts are extracted), I am just saying that this is probably not practical for a project like DBpedia which extracts data from multiple wikipedias. Cheers Andrea 2013/12/5 Paul Houle < > uThe \"DBpedia Way\" of extracting the citations probably would be to build something that treats the citations the way infoboxes are treated. It's one way of doing things, and it has it's own integrity, but it's not the way I do things. (DBpedia does it this way about as well as it can be done, why try to beat it?) A few years back I wrote a very elaborate Wikipedia markup parser in .NET, it used a recursive descent parser and lots and lots of heuristics to deal with special cases. The purpose of it was to accurately parse author and licensing metadata from Wikimedia Commons when ingesting images into Ookaboo. I had to do the special cases that because Wikipedia markup doesn't have a formal spec. I quickly ran into a diminishing returns situation where I had to work harder and harder to improve recall and get deteriorating results. I later wrote a very simple parser for Flickr which just parsed the HTML and took advantage of the \"cool URIs\" published in Flickr. Today I think of it as pretending that the Linked Data revolution has already arrived, because really if you look at the link graph of Flickr, there is a subset of it which isn't very different from the link graph of Ookaboo. Anyway, I needed to pull some stuff out of Wikimedia Commons and it took me 20 minutes to modify the Flickr parser to work for Commons and get at least 80% of the recall that the old parser got.

Well, yago:MotionPictureFilm103789400 rdfs:subClassOf yago:Film103338821 . OK so far, but up one more level leads to: yago:Film103338821 rdfs:subClassOf yago:PhotographicPaper103926412 Oops. That's not, then, the sense I want for the type of dbr:The_Sting. My limited understanding of YAGO is that it is mostly based on WordNet - is this just a problem created by mapping to the wrong synset for \"MotionPicture\"? Hopefully, yes, but I couldn't find the \"right\" one. There are a few other examples. -Chris PS above: PREFIX dbr: PREFIX yago: uHi Chris, Yago:MotionPictureFilm103789400 is the only handpicked type assertion in DBpedia-Yago, and it seems we actually got it wrong. The official Yago distribution doesn't contain films (because of some license-questions I think), so I added MotionPictureFilm103789400 manually. All other type assertion are based on Yago's algorithm. I think we should change that to Film106613686 (see [1]) which seems to me to be right. What do you think? Could you provide some examples from other domains than films please, would be interesting for later investigation. Cheers, Georgi PS: The Sting is an excellent movie!

Thus there is no common superclass of plays and musicals This is partly a wordnet problem, for some reason there is no composition sense for musical, just the performance sense. I'd agree that the play mapping is the right one for plays, and I see the musical mapping is the best you could do, but I think I'd prefer musicals to be mapped to the proper sense of play than to the wrong (but only available) sense for musicals. The corrected mapping you suggested below for movie also has the problem that it has no common superclass with play. Again that's a wordnet problem, I don't know why there isn't a sense (that I could find) for movie of a dramatic composition. Just an oversight I guess. -Chris Georgi Kobilarov wrote: uHi guys, First-off a confession; it was me who chose MotionPictureFilm103789400! Having said that, I'm not convinced it's wrong :) If you go far enough up from Film106613686 (the other proposal) you reach SocialEvent107288639, which seems equally incorrect to me, if not more so. For example, the *creative work* (which is what we're talking about, right?) known as \"Dodgeball\" that has a representation on the DVD which sits on my shelf might not be a subClass of photographic paper, but I'd argue it's even less a subClass of social event. (For the record, Film106262567 is another contender worth considering, but also not quite right). I'm afraid I don't really have a solution, other than to say lets not rush into a change that might also be suboptimal. All I can offer are the observations that: (from tedious experience) selecting these manually is really hard; doing so automatically is also pretty error prone ;) Maybe the best thing to bear in mind is which properties of \"films\" do we want to be able to model in DBpedia?

So i agree, neither of these choices is correct for movie. The problem appears to be that Wordnet (at least this version) doesn't have a synset for the creative work in a movie - there should be a synset that is more or less a sibling of novel, poem, etc., but I couldn't find one. As I said in a previous post (that doesn't appear to have made it to the list), there is a synset (107007945) for \"play\" that captures the creative work, but not one for musical. Apparently the wordnet team is not interested in entertainment. So personally I'd be happiest mapping movie (and musical) to that synset for play (107007945), as it seems to be the closest thing in wordnet to the sense of movie (and musical) that the wikipedia pages represent.

I was expecting that a change in change in the Wikipedia infobox of an article is mapped in DBpedia as an added/removed triple for the same article/resource. Second, based on the structure of live-updates of DBpedia there is an incompatibility between a folder and its correspondent zip folder, e.g., if we consider zip folder 2012-09-01.tar.gz and the folder 2012-09-01, we find that there are triples that are present in the former folder and missing in the latter one. Is it caused because the system is down sometimes? In case of a positive answer, which folder should we take in consideration for our analysis?

So far I dump the wiki content to an bzipped XML file and from that dump extract the templates and convert them to an SQL file and further on to SQLite3 file that I use in a small specialized search engine.

DBpedia is very focused on the specifics of Wikipedia and will be too difficult to apply in your case. SMW on the other hand is pretty easy to install and use and gives you the opportunity to semantically structure content in your Wiki and to embed queries and their results into your pages.

Undoing the addition (i.e. going back to the previous version) and validating leads to the same messages. So, should just keep ignoring those messages or it is something which can be fixed. Thank you. Cristian uHi Cristian, that's a problem in our validation. The errors occur in other classes, not in the one you are editing, but we check the whole ontology and show all errors. We should improve the validation and show better error messages. I don't know when we will have time. You can have look at Validate.scala [1], ExtractionManager.scala [2] and XMLLogHandler.scala [3] and try to fix this. The problem is basically that ExtractionManager.validateOntologyPages has to validate the whole ontology at once (because classes depend on each other), and XMLLogHandler collects all error messages. XMLLogHandler should collect only the error messages that are relevant for the current page. I'm not sure if that's really possible - some modifications in the current classes, e.g. changes to the type hierarchy, may cause errors in other classes - so another strategy could be that the log entry should at least show the name of the class where the error occurs. It would be cool if you or someone else could try to fix this.

"Question about DBpedia Years and some suggestions for dealing with Taxa"	"uHi, I am looking for useful URI's for years so that I can say the following kinds of things. I was looking at the DBpedia entries for this and found these and What I don't see is any markup that says that one year is *before* or *after * another like this 1758 AD testing I did not know if something like this would make sense or if I am missing something? Also if you look at following dbpedia-owl:binomialAuthority The object of *dbpedia-owl:binomialAuthority* should be a *foaf:Person* or list of *foaf:Person*(s) perhaps we need something else to markup the year that the taxon was described. Like *dbpedia-owl:yearDescribed, dbpedia-owl:binomialYearYou could also make these people a DBpedia subclass of *foaf:Person* like * dbpedia-owl:TaxonAuthor* (perhaps a subclass of dbpedia-owl:Scientist) The authority string like (Linnaeus, 1771) is sometimes referred to as the \"authority\", if this is in parenthesis it indicates that the original genus has been changed For example this species was originally named *Felis concolor* and had the authority string Linnaeus, 1771. e.g *Felis concolor *Linnaeus, 1771 What I would like to be able to do is have a visualization of the lifespans of different people, that also show what years they described species. This would be helpful in disambiguating taxonomic authors and finding errors in the taxonomic literature. I did not know if if would be best to link to the DBpedia years using the same DBpedia predicates or create custom URI's like above on my own, which interlink with the DBpedia URI's I have also notice that people often put trinomial names in the binomial field on Wikipedia and I was wondering if that is something that could be caught and fixed during the DBpedia processing? The binomial should consist of the genus and specific epithet e.g. \"*Puma concolor\"*, the trinomial should be the genus specific epithet and subspecific epithet like \"*Puma concolor couguar\".Also I was thinking that it might be good to capture the extinct symbol \"â \" used like â Smilodon on up the taxon with a an \"extinct\" URI something like dbpedia-owl:status dbpedia_category:extinct And remove the \"â \" character from dbpedia_prop:genus \"Smilodon\" You can also infer that if the family for this taxon is extinct than any subfamilies, genera, or species are also extinct. One last thing is that you can safely replace the \"&\" in the authority string with \"and\" in the RDF so (d'Orbigny & Gervais, 1844) => (d'Orbigny and Gervais, 1844). Respectfully, - Pete"
"infobox mappings"	"uHi, I have a problem with infobox Writer for Mappings (hr) For example, I have in Croatian edition of Wikipedia in wiki - mark up next situation with birth and death properties: roðenje = [[6. lipnja]] [[1854]].

This has two reasons: 1. The data for both the date and the place of birth go into the same template property. In the English Infobox_writer, the template properties birth_date and birth_place are split and it is therefore easier to extract both things with two PropertyMappings. If the properties could also be separate in the Croatian infobox, the same accurate mapping as for English could be taken. 2. The dates can have links. The extraction code currently cannot distinguish if a link is set on a place or on a date. It is assuming that all links are places (because of the mapping roðenje -> birthPlace). That is why it is extracting both the date and the place with the birthPlace relation. If we could always assume that the dates do not have links but only the places have links, the extraction would work as expected. Sidenote: the birthDate relation is not extracted because there is no support for Croatian date parsing in the framework at the moment. You could provide us with a list of months in Croatian and we could build this in. (we will be working on a way to configure these types of things more easily in the future.)

"DBpedia Lookup"	"uHi all, DBpedia provides Linked Data URIs for 2.6 million things. However, it wasn't always easy in the past for other Linked Data publishers to find a DBpedia URI. DBpedia Lookup [1] aims to fill that gap. It provides a service to find the most-likely DBpedia URIs for a given keyword. The underlying algorithm ranks DBpedia resources based on their relevance in Wikipedia and includes synonyms into the index. Try the terms \"Shakespeare\", \"EU\", or \"Cambridge\" and see for yourself if the results you'd expect show up at the top. The result ranking is different - and supposed to be more useful - than a simple full-text search or SPARQL-Query with embedded regular expression for matching labels. There is a web-service available at [2]. You can use the KeywordSearch method for searching full terms (as you see at [1]), and the PrefixSearch method for an autocompletion-style interface such as the one you see at [3]. The webservice returns a list of resource URIs with English abstracts, dbpedia classes and categories. Feel free to use the service as you like. If you plan to use it in a production system or to run a high-load batch process, please drop me a message to let me know. Thanks. I hope that DBpedia Lookup is useful for you, and I'd appreciate any feedback. Many thanks to the semantic web folks at the BBC for their support and feedback on the development of DBpedia Lookup.

You've already seen the solutions from Sindice and Georgi's DBpedia Lookup service. Here is our solution, which is basically revisiting the faceted \"Search\" and \"Find\" demo we put out a few weeks ago. As per my earlier mail, we have a hot staged DBpedia instance running on Virtuoso 6.x (our next major release), and this particular release will ship with: 1. Server hosted faceted search, find, and browse 2. Web Service Interface to the browser (*see link on the browser page*). Back to the problem, let's attempt to locate the URI on an Entity associated with the pattern: Telemann. I've chosen \"Telemann\" because Hugh Glaser makes a vital point using this example in relation to how we should start to expose Linked Data utility to newcomers. Steps: 1. Go to: 2. Change focus dimension (facet) to: Type via the link in the Navigation section (it's natural to use \"Type\" filtering to disambiguate when we attempt to locate things e.g., in the real world) 3. Now you have a list or Entities by Type, you can determine what specifically you are looking for 4. I assume a planet, so I click on the \"dbpedia-owl:Planet\" link 5. Now I have one dimension of interest, I flip over to the properties of the filtered entity set by clicking \"properties containing text\" from the Navigation section 6. Then I pick foaf:name as the property that should lead me to what I want (which is the answer to my search) 7. Click on the link and get both the URI and a description Note: This functionality is available as a Web Service [1], we desperately hope XML and JSON level developers can use the Web Service interface to basically match and exceed Parallax without losing the essence of the Linked Data Web (ie. keep: URIs in plain sight of user agents via @href when producing Web information resources from linked data queries nee.

OK, I think I don't quite understand what \"page counts\" really measure, as I hadn't expected this metric to take up so much extra space, and neither that it was so volatile. My impression was that this was a count of links from other wikipedia pages (or dbpedia entities) to the entity in question, which gives a rather non-subjective measure of importance. (Well, \"importance\" may still be a questionable interpretation, but still, not quite as bad as a popularity contest.) Am I misunderstanding what page counts measure ? Why take they up so much memory ? I'd think this could be compressed into (roughly) one number per entity. Or are all the link origins tracked, too ? (That could be useful, for example if the links are to be weighted according to the search criteria. But that definitely make things rather complex) Thanks, Stefan uThose counts to which you refer are \"incoming page links\" and the ones that Paul mentions are \"page views\". The latter are aggregated by time period so there are many numbers for one page even if you aggregate it into one number per week (using Paul's example). I think Paul meant that it is difficult to find a good period to sample so that you'd have one number per page that reflects whatever notion of importance you may have in mind.

Finding disambiguation pages is not hard: just look for certain template invocations, for example {{Disambig}}. That's what we do. The problem is that our list of disambiguation templates [3] is outdated. We should get the info from pages like some code that almost does that but didn't have time yet to finish the job [4]. I just updated Disambiguation.scala. To get the DisambiguationExtractor running you'll have to add a line to DisambiguationExtractorConfig.scala [2] - the part of the title that many disambig pages on nl.wp contain. Similar as in the other languages. If there are any other questions, let us know! Cheers, JC [1] [2] [3] [4] On Fri, Jun 15, 2012 at 5:15 PM, Meij, L.K. van der < > wrote:"

"DBpedia as Tables release 2014"	"uDear all, We are happy to announce the 2014 version of the DBpedia as Tables tool [1]. As some of the potential users of DBpedia might not be familiar with the RDF data model and the SPARQL query language, we provide some of the core DBpedia (Release 2014) data in tabular form as Comma-Separated-Values (CSV) files and as JSON files, which can easily be processed using standard tools, such as spreadsheet applications, relational databases or data mining tools. For each class in the DBpedia ontology (such as Person, Radio Station, Ice Hockey Player, or Band) we provide a single CSV/JSON file which contains all instances of this class. Each instance is described by its URI, an English label and a short abstract, the mapping-based infobox data describing the instance (extracted from the English edition of Wikipedia), geo-coordinates, and external links. Altogether we provide 685 CSV/JSON files packed in a single file (3.8 GB compressed). In addition, we also provide separate CSV/JSON files for each class for download. More information about the file format as well as the download link can be found on the DBpedia as Tables Wiki page [1]. Any feedback is welcome! Best regards, Petar and Chris [1] DBpediaAsTables"

The start of the thread is in the middle of this page: encoding which shouldn't have any effect on external URIs/IRIs/references/etc That's correct, and that's how the Scala script has always worked: it unescapes the MQL keys and uses the result to form DBpedia IRIs. The problems arise because some MQL keys contain invalid escapes (UTF-8 and Windows-1252 bytes instead of Unicode code points), and some others contain whitespace like U+2003 that is invalid even in IRIs. I would guess though that it's not a big problem because the affected keys are 1. not many, i.e. <1% and 2. not relevant anyway because they do not represent valid, current, non-redirect Wikipedia page titles. That's just a guess though, based on only a very cursory look at a few bad keys. I don't remember if these problems also came up when I ran the script on the old freebase dump format.

It might help to give a little background on how Freebase deals with these links. The canonical link uses the article number (in the namespace /wikipedia/en_id), but the alpha title (MQL key escaped) *and all redirects* are also stored (namespace /wikipedia/en). Additionally, the same information has recently been added for number of the other language wikipedias. You can see them all here for the example that Andrea mentioned: Outbound links from Freebase to Wikipedia are made using the article number, so that's really the most important link. The wisdom of including redirects is debatable, I think. Sometimes they're good alternate names, but other times they represent misspellings, related concepts, etc. If DBpedia has the Wikipedia article number, I'd suggest creating the links based on those. If not, I'd suggest using the redirect file to canoncialize on a single \"best\" link.

I assume Freebase also uses the current page title in triples like ns:m.09q3rp ns:common.topic.topic_equivalent_webpage . so I think we should simply use these lines. Of course, this will fail for the few Wikipedia page titles that changed between the time Freebase generates their links and DBpedia extracts its data, but that's no big deal.

There are multiple use cases for applications wanting to tap into the feed of updates, so I'm wondering if there a protocol or mechanism that is (or could be) documented to support pushing out of notifications of changes to resources?

However, once DBpedia-Live is running smoothly it will be relatively easy to create nightly dumps and we will also try to publish some kind of diffs or update logs in smaller increments, or even real-time. One posibility is to publish the updates as linked data itself - e.g. as suggested in our Triplify paper [1]. Anyway, it will probably aways be a pull mechanism instead of push, since there are lots of updates always - so you can be sure to get something new when you pull in updates.

"Announcement: DBpedia Faceted Browser and DBpedia User Script released"	"uHi all, We are pleased to announce the release of the DBpedia Faceted Browser [1] by Jona Christopher Sahnwaldt as well as the DBpedia User Script [2] by Anja Jentzsch. The DBpedia Faceted Browser allows you to explore Wikipedia via a faceted browsing interface. It supports keyword queries and offers relevant facets to narrow down search results, based on the DBpedia Ontology. In this manner, queries such as \"recent films about Buenos Aires\" can be easily and intuitively posed against DBpedia. The DBpedia Faceted browser was developed in cooperation with the search engine company Neofonie, which also kindly provided the funding for this project. The DBpedia User Script is a Greasemonkey script that enhances Wikipedia pages with a link to their corresponding DBpedia page and can be used within Firefox, Safari and Opera with a suitable Greasemonkey plugin.

Plus, it's built for DBpedia and thus makes use of redirects, link counts etc. for better result sorting.

Something I do find more useful in the immediate term is to bring in specialized heavyweight taxonomies & databases. For instance, ITIS, Mesh, PubChem, ATCCS, etc. For instance, if you look at an entry like this in wikipedia, you see that drugs (for instance) are really well connected to high-quality identifiers and categories. It's not a difficult project to bring those out and mesh them a little better with the DBpedia ontology. Conversely, it doesn't make a sense to put a lot of effort into classifying drugs or living species in much more detail because the job is already done. (Unless you're ~really~ into the details: I've done some work with ITIS because it's logically consistent, but there isn't 100% agreement between taxonomists about everything. I looked at about 20 cases where Wikipedia and ITIS disagreed about some detail came to the conclusion that Wikipedia had a more modern viewpoint about 80% of the time) Another interesting directions is to clearly identify \"genetic categories\" (Mallard Duck, Honda Civic) as related things and keep a clear distinction between \"members of a generic category\" and the \"generic category\" itself. For instance, it's true in some sense that any Person is a Eukaryote, but that's not a true relationship between a Person and Eukaryote in the Dbpedia ontology However, ought to be a Eukaryote. I'd really like to see the ultralightweight approach of the DBpedia ontology extended to things that are less concrete, things like \"concepts\", \"inventions\", \"products\", etc. There are quite a few really great types in Freebase such as \"toplevel domain\" that are concrete and easy to model that aren't currently available in DBPedia."
"Odp: DBpedia ontology - predicate constraints"	"uHi Jona, thanks, yes I am aware of the mapping wiki, in fact I have editor rights. I was wondering why the values are missing, so the simple answer is that so far nobody provided them. WRT to changing the domain - I think that this is not the best idea. Hometown seems to be a predicate designed specifically for people. From my POV there is an error in the mappings of \"Music band infobox\" (or sth similar) that wrongly maps English \"origin\" of the band to \"dbpedia-ontology:hometown\". I think that first we should define the constraints, then check for inconsistencies and finally fix the mappings. Correct me if I'm wrong. Cheers, Aleksander uHi Pablo, well, for me this seems a very interesting opinion, but I am pretty confused. First of all I guess these opinions are not equal in their support. Why I think so? Because when we drop argument constraints (I mean, we do not apply them if they are defined) we no longer follow the mathematical semantics theory, which I believe is the ground for SemanticWeb, and we adopt natural language semantics theory, with metaphor and other phenomena which are pretty hard to model using computers. Let me give you an example: there is a triple in DBpedia regarding Berlin - it is the \"country\" of e.g. City_Slang (a record label company). How can we interpret this \"fact\"? \"country\" has a \"Country\" constraint on its range and Berlin definitely is not a country. For me it's really hard to accept an interpretation in which \"country\" predicate is used for other places than countries (as values staying in the object position). Obviously there will be predicates that have a less stricter semantics than \"country\" and I can imagine using them in contexts not designed by their authors. Still in such cases providing extension to the original predicate definition would seem much better idea than just dropping any constraints. And the last thing - what is the primary point of providing types for entities in KBs such as DBpeida? I thought that they, together with the predicates' constraints, may greatly improve the quality of the KB. I know that you can make inferences based on the data, without any ontology or schema or whatever. You can improve the quality statistically, etc. Machine learning is doing pretty well without explicit constraints. But on the other hand - the DBpedia ontology, its types, predicates and the mappings from infoboxes to predicates are constructed manually. We can backtrack any invalidation of the constraints without problem. There might be many reasons for such situation - the object lacks the appropriate type assignment, the constraint is too narrow, the mapping is invalid or the original statement (i.e. infobox field) is invalid. In the last case this is a genuine problem of the data. In the case of the invalid mapping it can be easily fixed improving the quality of the hundreds or thousands of the extracted triples. So I place myself definitely in the schema camp. It would be very interesting to read some arguments coming from the data camp :-) Cheers, Aleksander uI agree totally with Aleksander. Further, Pablo, I also think it was wrong to frame this discussion as data v schema. A true *data* perspective should also respect to what the data applies and in what context. These are the express purposes of domain and range. Mike On 3/22/2014 5:30 PM, wrote: uWell, that is a straw man argument, because you picked a triple that contains a blatant error. Nobody is arguing that Berlin should become a country, or that we should reuse the property country in the wrong context. Nowthere is the need to detect that country is wrong in that context. This could be done with pre-defined domain/range, manually, or can be done automatically with probabilistic models as you pointed out. I am sure that everyone has their own definition for what a truly data driven approach means. But in the context of seeing the schema as constraints vs seeing it as merely more data, a truly data driven approach does not *respect* an arbitrary schema that was created with some unknown purpose in mind. It learns from the actual data usage and makes its own schema on the fly, perhaps even using the constraints in the schema as additional data points. There are arguments for both approaches. But I am not interested in debating this. Like I said, the data camp does not get hurt by more info. So please go ahead and summon the schema camp to contribute those constraints. The more data, the merrier. :) On Mar 22, 2014 8:29 PM, \"Mike Bergman\" < > wrote: uHi Jona, I just want to make one thing clear - if either domain or range has a owl:Thing \"constraint\" you don't export that information to the dbpedia.owl?

The workflow should be like this: 1) make your changes 2) provide the rational for the change in the talk page of the property / class, 3) if needed, discuss and coordinate efforts, 4) use the mailing list for very big changes. BTW, switching from owl:Thing to a high level class & in obvious cases like 'residence' might not need any documentation at all.

This way there won't be the problem with missing constraints, since they will default to owl:Thing. I started reviewing the constraints yesterday, but I am limiting these efforts to predicates that are most important for my current research (i.e. article categorization against Umbel). There are approx. 300 predicates that I am going to review. If anyone else wants to participate in that effort, let me know, so we can share some of the work or exchange ideas.

"Conditional mapping not working?"	"uHi again, I just tried to use a conditional mapping and somehow failed.

So I applied a conditional mapping to distinguish the two cases. Unfortunately if the otherwise branch holds true for a page then no template extraction for this page is performed, at all! If you test the mapping of you will recognize this behaviour at the first two entries displayed (Hellerau and Pillnitz). So what is wrong with the mapping? A second issue: Are there any possibilities of performing a more general conditional mapping? Sometimes it would be useful to have some conditions which are independent of each other. Say if in the former infobox there would have been the option to set the unit of area by appending \"acre\" or \"km2\" to the actual value. How would you realize the additional condition? And a third one: What if there was the need of linking several conditions? If the user could also choose the unit of elevation there would be the need to \"and\" the \"Höhe-bis\"-set condition and the \"Höhe\"-contains-\"acre\" condition. Is that possible?

In the mapping you'd have to make a condition based on which unit string is contained in the area property. The same holds true for the elevation property. But as far as I understood the syntax of mappings you cannot nest the conditions, can you?

"DBpedia in ReadWriteWebs Top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2009"	"uDear DBpedians, The new year is slowly approaching and people start compiling their top 10 lists of 2009. The popular Web technology blog ReadWriteWeb picked DBpedia as one of the top 10 Semantic Web products of 2009. Its actually the only non-commercial community project in the list and in good company with products such as Googles Search Options and Rich Snippets, Apperture and Data.gov. Other picks, which btw. heavily use or link to DBpedia, include OpenCalais, Freebase, BBC Music and Zemanta. Read the full article at Sören"
"DBpedia live: issues with classes and properties"	"uHi, I've just figured out some issues in the DBpedia Live export, compared to the \"static\" version. First, it seems that RDF typing is not fully done in the live version. Eg vs The static version expose values for rdf:type such as:  dbpedia-owl:AdministrativeRegion  dbpedia-owl:PopulatedPlace  dbpedia-owl:Place That are not in the live version, which actually does not expose any types from the DBpedia ontology (yago + cyc only) Then, property export is also done differently. Considering the same resource, the static version exposes its mayor using dbpedia-owl:mayor and dbprop:mayor But the live version exposes only dbprop:major However, considering the ontology / mappings wiki, it seems that dbpedia-owl is the right way to go, right ? Is that something that the team is working on ? Or, should we consider the current DBpedia live export as the way DBpedia will go re. typing and the ontology used ? Thanks, Alex. uHi, DBpedia-Live is still working on the old PHP framework, so it uses old mappings, which are fixed and can not be changed. It basically has these three major issues: - Mappings can not be edited - Mappings are only used partially - Abstracts are not correctly updated (only abstract_live) We will not fix this in the current setup (PHP framework), but we are already quite far rewriting the Live framework in Java. This will have full and up-to-date abstracts, full support of everything in the Mappings Wiki and will structurally be similar to the latest DBpedia dump, albeit only for English language. Mohamed Morsey [1] is currently working on the rewriting and he is almost finished with the development and is moving on to testing. The problem is that the Live Extraction is difficult to test. Lots of data, lots of updates and is hard to reproduce errors, because they occur in one article at a certain revision only. After the basics are finished, we will set up a store with the new live framework and then we need feedback from the community and users in order to find some more bugs. After this we will commit some time in update logs (in conjunction with OpenLink ) and also will implement some update strategies for the case that mappings change in the Wiki (imagine you change a property mapping and 10.000 triples have to be changed, with the most difficult part is finding the triples). By the way, we still hope someday to be able to move our mappings wiki within the unified login area of the Wikipedias and in general do the editing there (i.e. add more Semantics).

This would not be a bad idea. But we are open to other suggestions, in case you have any. We started an attempt to keep everything that is in the mappings Wiki now in Wikipedia. But it failed for several reasons It is a hard read: The general idea is that people from Wikipedia and DBpedia can encode formal facts and information directly in the source, i.e. Wikipedia.

Is the current codebase of the live extractor available from SVN / GIT ? I was thinking of something similar, or maybe with a more community oriented workflow. Once a change is proposed, there's a short timeframe (e.g. 3 to 5 days) for voting. If only +1 or no votes after the deadline, change is approved. If at least one -1, that's subject to discussion and the mapping is not validated unless -1 is removed. Right, thanks for the links !

"object property extractor should check rdfs:range"	"uConsider dbo:firstAccentPerson, which declares rdfs:range dbo:Person.

The file at on the other hand, looks more like a Turtle file because it has prefixes, unlike a real N-Triples file. The .json file has back links, but it is in a non-standard format. The .jsonld file does NOT have the back links.

"Odp: Hello DBPedia!"	"uHi, following the discussion regarding deficiencies of the DBpedia ontology, I would like to make you know that a team of collaborators sponsored by Structured Dynamics is working on classification of the Wikipedia articles into the Umbel [1] ontology. Yet another ontology, you may think, but Umbel is exceptional in the regard that it is entirely based on Cyc [2] - a more than 20-year effort of building an ontology large enough to capture entire common sense knowledge. We address many of the problems that are present both in Wikipedia and DBpedia, e.g. things like list and disambiguation pages, administrative categories in Wikipedia, compound categories in Wikipedia, etc. The good news is that exactly this week we've produced the first \"final\" result of the classification, i.e. around 90% of the Wikipedia articles has a Umbel type (we use ~4k different types in the classification) assigned via a mapping between Wikipedia categories and Umbel types. I am writing in quotes, since that result still has to be validated and curated and we are probably not going to publish it just at the moment. Still, I expect some consumable results to be produced in May, so stay tuned. What is more - regarding the problem of integrating the data from different data sources - I used Cyc, especially its conflict detection mechanism, in the past [3] to integrate classification results produced by various type assignment methods. For me it seems to be the best resource applicable in that problem, since besides the generalization relation, which is found in all the ontologies, most of the classes have disjointWith statements, even on a level of Cats and Dogs (i.e. individual species). As a result it is relatively easy to keep the data coherent. Kind regards, Aleksander [1] [2] [3] paper2.pdf uOn 4/10/14 5:40 AM, wrote: Yes, I am aware of UMBEL [1].

The new release includes: * Loosely-coupled SSL/TLS SSL/TLS version and associated cipher selection is now configurable. Net effect, you can now explicitly disable the use of specific SSL/TLS versions (e.g., SSL/TLS 3.0, which is susceptible to the POODLE exploit). * Improved LDP Support Linked Data Platform protocol support has been enhanced, as an extension to existing WebDAV protocol support. Specific WebDAV folders can now be designated as LDP Containers, and once this designation has been made, LDP-aware user agents will be able to deductively interact with WebDAV Folders and the documents they contain, using entity relations embedded in both header and body of HTTP responses. * WebDAV access to 3rd Party Storage Services 3rd Party Storage Services (e.g., Dropbox, Amazon S3, Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Box, Rackspace, etc.) are mountable and un-mountable using an asynchronous operation (in prior releases, this was a synchronous operation). Once mounted, these 3rd party folders function like any other WebDAV resource. This kind of WebDAV collection (a \"Dynamic Extension Resource Type\" or \"DET\" for short) can also be designated as an LDP Container, making Virtuoso WebDAV a powerful LDP proxy mechanism for storage services that do not currently support LDP. * File System Hosted Virtual Tables Enables Virtuoso instances to attach to CSV documents hosted by the File System. Once attached, VIEWs of these documents can be represented as SQL Relational Tables (by default) and/or RDF Property/Predicate graphs (via RDF Views functionality). * Loosely-Coupled Sponger Middleware Services Built-in RDF document transformation middleware is now loosely- coupled to its host Virtuoso database server instance. As a result, you can now use the POST method to request asynchronous data transformation services from a Sponger instance, with the transformed data returned as part of an HTTP response payload. * Built-in Nanotation Processor Enables automatic transformation of TURTLE statements embedded in Email Messages, Online Discussion Posts, Tweets, Social Media Posts (Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+), HTML Body, and Plain Text documents into RDF-based Linked Open Data, which is then stored in the host Virtuoso instance. You now have the freedom, power, and flexibility to create data wherever and whenever"

And I hope they will start publishing their data as Linked Data Cheers, Georgi [1] uHi Georgi Thanks for the pointer. Faviki is indeed great. I'd never be convinced by any social bookmarking so far, because I found tags so messy, but I've adopted Faviki right away ( adoption curve seems to be steep since yesterday. One interesting potential feature is the feedback towards Wikipedia editors themselves. They can tap in the resources indexed on their favourite articles to improve the article content. So this is a good example to monitor of social semantic feedback. Bernard Georgi Kobilarov a écrit : uHi Bernard, Faviki is a service that I have waited for a long time. I used del.icio.us in the past, but its social component was mostly irrelevant to me. I want to use a bookmarking service for my own personal benefit of storing and remembering websites. This social stuff is great if it makes it easier for me to reach my goal, and the delicious tag recommendation is a good example. People tag their stuff, and by doing so they help other users. But I would never contribute to delicious *just* to help other users (and to train the recommendation algorithm). Here's a fantastic blog post about that relation of personal benefit and social systems: Faviki has great potential, but IMHO they have to find a way to use DBpedia's semantic graph to provide additional *personal* value to their users. The potential feature of contributing to Wikipedia you've mentioned is indeed very interesting, but the system has to be built in a way that these social contributions happen as a side effect of people using the system because they love it for the personal problems it solves. Cheers, Georgi uOk, I looked a bit closer at Faviki, and the way they use the categorization and classification data is brilliant. Still wondering whether/how this will actually help me in daily use, but I'm very excited!!! uHi all, Faviki provides RSS 1.0 for a bookmark list, and tags to each item are included as DBpedia URIs, e.g. Notice that, besides somewhat obsolete taxo:topic + rdf:Bag/rdf:li model, DBpedia URIs are 'data' rather than 'resource'. What do you think, as tag object, is good URI in this case ? I guess would be straightforward, but any rationale to use 'data' URIs here ? cheers, uThanks for the pointer to their RSS! The use of dbpedia.org/data/ is clearly wrong! Must be dbpedia.org/resource/. I don't have an opinion about dc:subject compared to taxo:topics + Bags Cheers, Georgi uHi Georgi Georgi Kobilarov a écrit : In this case, why not simply using your browser bookmarks? If I think only of personal benefit, the one I see in social bookmarking is discovering more relevant resources around the ones I know of. Sharing is a win-win strategy, I think all the history of web technologies is there to support this thesis. Of course. This is not a question of technology, it's the basis of sociality. Why do we exchange on this forum or other ones? Well, it's amazing that people need to look at social bookmarking to re-discover the basic principles of social life. They are not different for the network. Hanging my favorites on DBpedia concepts is indeed adding personal values. The auto-completing tagging made me discover already Wikipedia stuff I did not know. Not to mention other bookmarks that other will tag with the same. And navigation to related topics and categories makes me discover more. The personal benefit is obvious for me. Well this is a strange assertion to me. Why do people contribute to Wikipedia? What is the personal reward? Don't forget that DBpedia, and hence the possibility of a tool like Faviki, and of DBpedia being the backbone of the Linked Data cloud, is just a \"side effect\" of the huge work of the Wikipedia community. Granted DBpedia formalize the semantics, but if the semantics were not already implicitly embedded in Wikipedia pages (and first of all, its subject-centic nature), there would not be anything to build upon. So why would this very community not use the social semantic loop, the added value of resources bookmarked on DBpedia concepts, to augment the Wikipedia content itself, and enter in a virtuous semantic circle? I think we have to see those tools in the Big Picture of collective intelligence emergence. The social success of Wikipedia has proven that this is not a void concept. Cheers Bernard uHi DBpedia Folks! Please sorry for my delayed responses. I'm very glad that folks from DBpedia like (and use) Faviki! I think DBpedia is a great project, and hope it will continue to develop. Version 3.0 has some great improvements (especially disambiguation and redirect extractions, and I hope they will be perfected in the future). Abstracts are pretty important, and I think they should be better. I believe mess appears because of removing urls from text (besides Wikipedia inconsistency)? Did you consider another alternative abstract with urls left inside? I noticed links (to other Wikipedia articles) in the first couple of paragraphs of Wikipedia article are usually pretty related to article itself. If abstract in Faviki have links (to Faviki pages about tags), or an option to show only that related tags, I believe it would be another great way to navigate and learn about stuff. I agree that general problem with social and collaborative systems is that they must provide a benefit for the user, when there are not much data. It seems that good ideas often fail because they're highly dependent on large number of users and their activity. In my opinion, the challenge is to make a system which will be useful if there is only one user, and let the real benefit (coming from many nodes and interconnections) comes later. That's what I'm trying to do with Faviki. :) In my vision Faviki will evolve toward connecting the people with tags and websites and defining types of webpages (using predefined predicates), that was actually the original idea of Faviki, but I decided to start with smaller and more focused version in order to provide easier adoption and understanding of its key values I'm glad we have a similar thoughts about connecting it with Wikipedia. I really believe there is a potential, and that Wikipedia can benefit, too. I fixed RSS- changed DBpedia URI from 'data' to 'resource' It would be nice to keep in touchI would like to hear suggestions and ideas from you, from the perspective of DBpedia creators and Faviki users. Best wishes from sunny Belgrade, Vuk Milicic uHi Vuk, 2008/5/28, Vuk Milicic < >: Very nice to see such a prompt action. Thanks ! May I suggest a few more points on Faviki RSS ? (1) Item URI: current RSS uses bookmarked document's URI for item's rdf:about. This would cause several problems: - dc:creator means its object is a creator of the subject (item). Since this RSS assigns a user to dc:creator's object, this asserts that one who bookmarked had created the document, which is not true in most cases. - once aggregated, items with the same URI will be merged, and then a document (denoted by the URI) will have multiple dc:creator, dc:date etc. For example, see RSS for one document (e.g. I guess the items here would be bookmarks rather than target documents. So why not assign a bookmark URI (e.g. use to provide the target document URI so that RSS readers properly show hyperlinks. (2) rdf:Bag/rdf:li : the RDF container model has some problems (e.g. for SPARQL query) and is generally considered obsolete. Would you use direct multiple properties for multiple tags, e.g.: This is not a major suggestion, but certainly welcome improvement to already great RDF data. Thank you. uHi Kanzaki, Thank you very much for your suggestions! I changed item URIs and rdf:bag part. Can you please check it out (e.g. I am not sure what should I do in the case when bookmarks are sorted by popularity (e.g. blank. I'm not sure if this is ok. You can check it on Thanks, Vuk On Thu, May 29, 2008 at 3:51 AM, KANZAKI Masahide < > wrote: uHi Vuk, Thank you very much for RSS updates! Looks marvellous. Because it's getting so nice, I can't help asking to fine tune the model a little bit more. May I ? (1) dc:subject Now the items denote bookmarks, not target documents, it seems somewhat strange that an item (a book mark) has dc:subjects (because they are the subjects of the target document). If you don't mind adding one more namespace declaration, it would be better to use Tag ontology [1], and replace dc:subject with t:associatedTag, e.g.: xmlns:t=\" (document_uri) etc. (It would be still better if you include to generate a triple to connect the tag=item and the document, but I'm afraid this might be too much asking you ?) (2) value of dc:creator It's good idea to have user (tagger) URI as value of dc:creator. It would be much better if you use instead of literal value ( http). (3) non declared XML entities For some reasons, this RSS includes several XHTML entity references such as &acirc;, &brvbar;, &atilde;, etc. These are declared in XHTML DTD, but not predefined XML entities. This makes the RSS ill-formed, and would cause fatal errors in XML applications. (This is not an RDF issue, but RSS/XML in general). I'd suggest use numerical reference such as &#x123; (or %HH encoding for URI) if necessary. OK, in this case, the items are the target documents, rather than tags assigned by Faviki users. So, you can safely use target document URIs for rdf:about attributes on each item (and rdf:li in items). You can still use thing as document uri does. The values of dc:creator and dc:date for this item should be those of the target document, which are usually not known in bookmarking system. Hence, you can omit these properties (better than blank properties). In turn, dc:subject is fine in this case. If you are interested in Tag ontology, you might want to use t:taggedWithTag in place of dc:subject (this would look somewhat tricky, but works). I appreciate very much your effort to make Faviki RDF output better. thank you and best regards, [1] uHi Kanzaki, Thank you so much for your time and advice. Please! I'm not the semweb expert, so every advice is welcomed :) I did it, but have two concerns about this: - Will RSS readers/aggregators (e.g. friendfeed) will still be able to read RSS easily? - I am considering using MOAT ontology, too. As far as I understand it, MOAT extends Richard Newman's tag ontology and provide a way to deal with tags with different meanings. I'm not sure if this is needed for Faviki, because ambiguous tags are automaticly redirected. Did you mean ? Should I leave tag or remove it completely? Can I remove some of the namespaces that are not used, like ' Best regrads, Vuk On 6/1/08, KANZAKI Masahide < > wrote: uVuk Milicic wrote: [snip] Please use the MOAT and SCOT ontologies in conjunction with SIOC.

Yes, as far as I know, RSS readers respect vocabularies they know (e.g. RSS 1.0, DC etc.), and just ignore those they don't. Actually, Bloglines and Google reader can aggregate the revised Faviki RSS without any problem. Ah, well, t:associatedTag is usually used to relate a context dependent Tag (e.g. tags in del.icio.us, whose meaning might be different for each user). MOAT could be used to give a global meaning to such Tag. Here, however, Faviki uses DBpedia resources as the tag, whose semantics are already defined. I guess you don't need to further define the meaning of them with MOAT. (It could be debatable whether t:associatedTag is really appropriate here, though) Yes, sorry (I had Tag ontology in mind). Leave it. RSS readers rely on tag to find bookmarked document's URI. Although looks redundant, each serves different purpose. I recommend to use both taggedResource and link. Sure. If you do not use terms from that namespace, you can safely remove such xmlns: declaration. best, uHi Kingsley, Kanzaki Thank you very much for help.

"procedural suggestions for mapping wiki"	"uHi everyone! Being a newcomer to the dbpedia mapping wiki, I'm discovering the power of the idea. But one thing I'm missing from other wikis, is DISCUSSION about editorial decisions. Notably on wikidata: - there's a lot of discussion before a property is introduced, e.g. see - there's a lot of rich metadta, including discussion but also validation rules etc: Eg see DNB identifier: Having such discussions on this mailing list is suboptimal, to say the least. So I have the following procedural suggestion: - make a project - for every bug or suggestion, use the appropriate property's Discussion page to decide what to do, and to document it. E.g. for gender: I also miss some editorial templates that would be very useful for these discussions, e.g.: {{support}}, {{oppose}}, {{question}}, {{comment}}, {{ping}} (But {{comment}} is taken for rdfs:comment) Note: I've only been on wikidata for a week but already found them very useful.

"DBPedia freshness"	"uCan someone let me know which Wikipedia data dump file it is that is the input to DBPedia? On the Wikipedia SQL-Dump\". Is it this one we talk about?

Is there anything preventing DBPedia to create a fresher dump from the data at I'm curious to know if the reason the data is not fresh is an issue with that someone actually has to manually download the Wikipedia data and run the scripts (and it has just not been done yet), or if the issue is technical somehow and that it has failed with newer data? Thanks /Omid uHi Omid, there are several Wikipedia dump files we are importing in order to extract the data for DBpedia (see the importwiki.php in the DBpedia SVN). It is true that DBpedia is quite out of date at the moment. There has been a lack of Wikipedia dumps during winter and spring, but Wikipedia recently started to publish dumps much more frequently. We are currently in the process of preparing DBpedia 3.3, based on a late May dump of the English Wikipedia (and dumps of other languages around that time). I can only roughly estimate when DBpedia 3.3 will be available, but keep an eye on the DBpedia mailinglist around end of next week Cheers, Georgi uThanks Georgi, I have also noted that Wikipedia significantly has increased the frequency with which they are releasing their dumps. I remember there was a period from October 2008 to early this year when no new dumps were completed for 5-6 months time. The question is, how much manual work and how long processing time is there for DBPedia to release a new dump once a new Wikipedia dump is released. Assume that Wikipedia would start releasing complete data dumps on a daily basis, would DBPedia theorietically be able to release dumps also on a daily basis? Or is the processing itself require for example one week of processing making impossible to have DBPedia daily fresh even if Wikipedia would have their data dumps daily fresh. Basically I try to figure out what the minimum delay would be from a new Wikipedia dump is released to that a new DBPedia is released is with the current DBPedia scripts. Also, if the process currently involves many manual steps (to download Wikipedia dump, process the data etc.), is it something that could very easily be automated so that keeping DBPedia fresh would not involve any human intervention?

But due to the bunch of code changes, we were facing some bugs and extraction errors. Nothing to worry about, but it requires time to get up to speed again. And since DBpedia still is kind of a spare time project for all participants among our other research projects, we don't always find the time to work on it. In the long-term, DBpedia will probably only rely on the Wikipedia update feed instead of the Wikipedia dump files. There will be daily or weekly diffs, monthly full dumps and hopefully a DBpedia live feed as well. I hope that sounds reasonable. If not, please let us now.

In the html rendering all such labels end with a \" character, for example some labels for * Frans (nl) * Franska (sv) * Französische Sprache\" (de) * Français\" (fr) Using SPARQL query what I get for the latter label is as following Fran\u00E7ais\\" (in the html answer) FranÃ§ais' (in the xml answer) Given that all Wikipedi pages are correctly encoded in UTF-8, if I judge by what I got in my extraction for lingvoj.org there is a bug somewhere in the label processing from dbpedia side.

The link to the pagelink file does not work and so I wonder if the file still exists, and if so from where can it be downloaded. The second issue is with the number of triplets. Howcome an older version (3.0RC) has more triplets than latter versions (3.0 and 3.1)? What changed in the middle? One last question, regarding all versions. Are names preserved throughout all version? Are there pages which name changes with time so that they are called differently in two different DBpedia dumps?

Since release 3.5 (April 2010), there's a workaround: DBpedia now also extracts the Wikipedia page ID [1], which does not change when a page is renamed. RDF triples for the page IDs are published in the \"page_ids\" files. To find out which DBpedia resource names have changed from one version to the next, you could write scripts that analyze these files: look for lines that have the same page ID in both files but different URIs. Maybe someone has already done that, I don't know. Could be done with a few lines in bash. Regards, JC [1]"

"Distance in DBpedia"	"uHi everyone, i trying to find a way to calculate the distance between two resurces withing dbpedia. I thought i could make a sareis of joins in sparql like this SELECT ?1 ?2 ?3 WHERE { { ?p1 ?1.} UNION {?1 ?p2 .} {?1 ?p3 ?2.} UNION {?2 ?p4 ?1.} {?3 ?p5 ?2.} UNION {?2 ?p6 ?3.} { ?p7 ?3.} UNION {?3 ?p8 .} } until i found at least one way between the resources, but as i thought this kind of approach is really too heavy to compute and starting from 3 steps or more it will result in a timeout from the server executing the sparql query. So i was reading this article: Discovering Unknown Connections â the DBpedia Relationship Finder where are described two algorithms: the first one is a clustering one witch divides the whole rdf triples in clusters of conncted sub-graphs and assigns a distance value from a single random resource to all the others. The other one does more or less what i'm trying to do, calculating the ways that connect two nodes (also calculating the minimum distance and the maximum distance as absolute value of the difference and the sum of the relative distances to the central resource), but there's this instruction: \"formulate SQL query for obtaining at most (n ô m) connections between O1 and O2 of length d without objects and properties in the ignore list;\" so it is similar to my original ideai really would have liked to see how it is implemented in an efficent way, so i downloaded the code but i was unable to run it bacause of a db problem (it requies a statement table and i donno where it cames from) and still can't find where this implementation is within the sourcecode. By the way, have someone tried to solve this problem? are there any kind of suggestion? I thought another possiblity could be the sequent: starting form the clsuterized rdf triples in the article, construct two trees with the 2 resoruces we want to find the distance as roots. Then each son is a connected resource with a distance from the central resource fo the cluster wich is less than root's distance from the center. At the n-th level (where n is the distance from the central resource of the root resource) we will have the central resource for sure. Then for each resource in the first tree we search for it in the second one. Then we save every matching reasource in a list with the sum of the distances from the roots in the two trees. Once every resource is checked, the resurce in the list with the smaller value is the resource that minimizes the distance between the two nodes. The worst situation is that there are no common resources in the trees other than the central resource. Maybe this works but it's a bit elaborate and probably hard to computemaybe there's a simplier way. Any suggestion?

I managed to find the functions i need in the relfinder sourcecode (they were in the index.php) and i realized how the database query are done, and as i thought they were practically a series of joins. By the way i can't get things working because o the statements table: can someone who tried this come tell me how to construct it? May i use the dbpedia csv dumps and import them in a mysql table like this: ( `subject` varchar(255) collate latin1_general_ci NOT NULL, `predicate` varchar(255) collate latin1_general_ci NOT NULL, `object` varchar(255) collate latin1_general_ci NOT NULL, `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`) ) ? (this is the code of the CopyTable from the relfinder sourcecode) I hope someone will answer this time :( Thanks anyway, Piero Molino uHello, Piero Molino wrote: At the time we wrote the Relationship Finder, the statements table was easy to create. You just had to download the csv file of the DBpedia release and load it into your database. Now things have changed a bit since then. You have to perform slight modifications of the extraction code. I prepared a csv file for you here: In a next step, you have to load the data into your DB, which can be done using e.g. this PHP script on the command line: $connection = mysql_connect('localhost',$user,$pass,true); mysql_select_db('dbpedia_relfinder', $connection) or die(mysql_error()); mysql_query(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS statements\") or die(mysql_error()); mysql_query(\"CREATE TABLE `statements` ( `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment, `subject` varchar(255) collate latin1_general_ci NOT NULL default '', `predicate` varchar(255) collate latin1_general_ci NOT NULL default '', `object` text collate latin1_general_ci, `object_is` char(1) collate latin1_general_ci NOT NULL default '', PRIMARY KEY (`id`), KEY `s_sub_pred_idx` (`subject`(200)), KEY `s_pred_idx` (`predicate`(200)), KEY `s_obj_idx` (`object`(250)) ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 COLLATE=latin1_general_ci;\" ) or die(mysql_error()); mysql_query(\"LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'infobox.csv' IGNORE INTO TABLE statements\") or die(mysql_error()); ? The second step is computing the components of the RDF graph. To do this, you have to execute cluster_main.php on the commandline. This can take hours or even days depending on your machine. Regarding the queries, you are right that they are basically joins. We can very easily detect whether two resources are in the same component of the graph and - as you read in the paper - we can also efficiently give a minimum and maximum value for the distance between two resources. The hard part is to detect the exact distance. Using MySQL, we found that joins performs quite reasonable if the distance is below 8 (if I remember correctly). In the meantime I have also seen other (relatively recent) approaches to compute the distance between resources, which are particularly targeted at large graphs. However, I do not have a handy literature reference available. Currently, we are thinking about reviving the DBpedia Relationship Finder and are looking at ways to provide this tool without the involved maintenance overhead of keeping it up-to-date. This means that we will probably use SPARQL queries against Virtuoso. This approach works well for distances up to 3/4. (You can try SPARQL queries against the official DBpedia endpoint to test this.) Kind regards, Jens uHello, Piero Molino wrote: This looks like it should work, but performing UNION and JOINS efficiently is probably very hard for Virtuoso in this case. Using LIMIT 1 and maybe a filter !isLiteral(?something) may give you better performance. You already found out that the implementation is in the DBpedia subversion in the /relfinder directory. One reason why the queries are more efficient than the one above is that we use a precomuted table storing all triples \"in both directions\", i.e. for each triple S-P-O we also store O-P-S. This way we do not need the union you mentioned above and MySQL can better optimise the joins on the statements table. We obviously also filter all cases where S or O are literals and remove some properties we do not want when computing the connection between two objects. Getting all nodes with smaller distance from the root node and connected to a specific node is computationally not a problem. What is likely to be a problem is the number of nodes you have in those two trees, which may grow very fast. Another problem is that you won't have a guarantee to get the distance this way: Say you have a complete graph with three vertices a, b, root. If you ask for the distance between a and b using your method it would return 2 instead of one. (There are also other counterexamples.) The reason is that going towards the randomly chosen root node of a component does not necessarily mean that you are walking on a shortest path.

Ok i'll try it later today so that i can leave the computer calculate and enjoying himself :) Yes that is clear from the paper and is a really clever idea.

"Missing DBpedia resources ?"

Could someone explain why ? Thanks, Rob uHey Rob, Interesting one Yes, I can. There simply are no triples matching the pattern {dbpedia:iPhone ?p ?o . } The output pages (dbpedia.org/page/ and dbpedia.org/data/) are generated on-the-fly via a \"DESCRIBE \" query, which is equivalent (in Virtuoso's implementation, no necessarily by spec) to SELECT * where { ?p ?o . } UNION SELECT * where { ?s ?p . } In your example, there are only S P dbpedia:iPhone triples available. If you look at dbpedia.org/page/iPhone you will see, that the properties are named \"is blabla of\", which indicates that those triples match to { ?s ?p dbpedia:iPhone .} Apple's mobile phone you are looking for has the URI really an interesting example, because the URI does not match the article's title in Wikipedia (which has a lower case \"i\").

Only 8,664 invalid facts were found in DBpedia Live, compared to 247,557,030 valid facts. The predominant problem in DBpedia Live turned out to be noncomfortmant IRIs that came in from Wikipedia.

I've got scripts that download them all and import them automatically, and they all broke because of the file name change. (Some of them broke because of other changes, too) Generally I'm a distrusting sort of fellow (i-n-t-J), so dbpedia assertions go through a \"closed world\" filter before they get into my system. Something funky turns up with every new dbpedia dump, often harmless or easy to adapt to. Changing property names sticks out like a sore thumb: these kind of problems get handled before they result in broken joins and failing queries. Overall, I think the the public SPARQL interface is good for (i) little \"touch up\" projects against your own database and (ii) people who write conference papers rather than build working systems. My web sites get enough visitors that I get complaints about things that are wrong, even about little obscure things: if I'm making a list of \"important\" cities, I'll need NYC, London and Tokyo to make the list. This isn't just a problem with dbpedia, it's pretty universal in the \"generic database\" space. Freebase has pretty much the same issues, and I gave up on a plan to extract a few thousand \"facts\" from the OSM API because, as usual, (i) the API is poorly documented, (ii) the data format is poorly documented, and (iii) I couldn't get any help from the mailing list.

Unfortunately, we mistakingly encoded the \",\" character, thanks for the hint. This behavior will be fixed in the next Release. The current behavior is as follows: - The alphanumeric characters \"a\" through \"z\", \"A\" through \"Z\" and \"0\" through \"9\" remain the same. - The special characters \".\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\", \":\" and \"_\" remain the same. - The space character \"Â \" is converted into a plus sign \"_\". - All other characters are unsafe and are first converted into one or more bytes using UTF-8 encoding. Then each byte is represented by the 3-character string \"%xy\", whereÂ xyÂ is the two-digit hexadecimal representation of the byte. - Furthermore, multiple underscores are collapsed into one.

"The difference between infobox downloads"	"uHello, this is my first post to this list, I'm glad to have found it. My question is this - on the downloads page there is an option for \"Infoboxes\" and \"Ontology Infoboxes\". What is the difference between the two? I've noticed a few differences - \"Ontology Infoboxes\" appears to have substantially more data in it (or am I off here?) and the predicates between the two different sets of triples appear to be different: Infoboxes: IO: What's the difference between the \"property\" and \"ontology\" in the predicates? Thanks in advance for any light you can shed on this. Ander Murane uHello, Ander Murane schrieb: Both data sets are the result of extracting information from Wikipedia infoboxes. The \"Infoboxes\" data set extracts the information using a generic approach, i.e. each attribute $foo in a Wikipedia infobox is translated to a property the \"Ontology Infoboxes\" data set uses a mapping based approach, i.e. there is a manually maintained set of mapping rules. For instance the attribute $foo could be mapped to extracts more data and the latter one extracts cleaner data. In particular different spellings of an attribute are often mapped to the same property. Kind regards, Jens"

"Multilingual properties in the new DBpedia release"	"uHi all, There is some weird things in the new release of DBPedia regarding its multi-lingual aspect and related properties. If I look at properties such as: By translating these _percent_xx to %xx, we got an hebrew property name. Can these named with _percent_ be fixed ? However, my main concern is that these properties re-define already existing ones (in that case the death date) and are not mapped with then. For instance, to find the death date in hebrew, I must do SELECT ?date WHERE { ?date } Instead of using a common property and applying a lang filter. That imho strongly limits the use of DBpedia as a multilingual knowledge base. I guess multi-lingual mapping is not an easy task in the extraction process, but do you plan to focus on that for the next release ? Thanks, Alex. uOn 5 Nov 2009, at 13:57, Alexandre Passant wrote: [] (I meant resource, not page) uHi Alexandre, DBpedia 3.4 extracts datasets from Wikipedia editions in 91 different languages. As with previous releases, we provide all this data for download from the DBpedia download page, but only load a subset of the data into the DBpedia SPARQL endpoint which also creates the DBpedia HTML interface. There has been a misunderstanding between someone at my team and someone at Openlink and therefore all data from all languages has been loaded into the public endpoint. The strangely looking URIs are a result of this. We currently work on getting only usual subset loaded into the endpoint. Therefore the strangely looking property URIs will quickly disappear and the RDF links into other LOD datasets that are currently not loaded will appear again. Sorry for the confusion! Doing Wikipedia cross-language data fusion is indeed tricky. We did some experiments with this, see paper below, but don't think we will be able to provide this for the complete dataset anytime soon.

Tom. uHi Chris, I've been working with the DBpedia dataset to try and extract Films and assorted metadata for a couple of days now; I've a few observations of things which may or may not have been brought to Georgi or Pavel's attention already. Apologies if I'm repeating what you already know! Notes on DBpedia data (generally found through examining of Film infoboxes and classes, but may hold true on a wider scale!): * The assertion of rdf:type can be somewhat hit-and-miss. There are resources described with type yago:Film which also have type, for example, yago:Train. Furthermore, there are Things for which the assertion rdf:type yago:Film may be debatable - are the categories around Films (e.g. dbpedia:Category:Film, dbpedia:Category:Films_from_1999 etc.) really of type Film? There are around 30,000 Things to be found of type Film, only around 12,000 (according to the stats on dbpedia.org/docs and to those I've found) of which are actually films. In general, those which are not films or categories about films are cinemas, tv series, etc. These do not typically have a dbpedia:director or dbpedia:starring predicate, while real films do (this was the most accurate metric I could devise to find the difference, without trying to read in the entirety of the dataset at once and performing and smarter inference! I'd be interested to hear how you came about the number on the DBpedia website!) * The parser from Wikipedia to RDF does a slightly hit-and-miss job of parsing lists of, for example, those starring in a film. Some of these are done perfectly, with URIs for the star (particularly in some more mainstream, and thus better maintained, film entries). Others, however, can be found in the wiki format [[Person One]][[Person Two]][[Person Three]], Person OnePerson TwoPerson Three, or (even harder to get around!) Person One Person Two Person Three, or some combination of these; \"[[Richard Madeley]],(Unaired pilot);[[Jeremy Beadle]],([[1990]]-[[1997]]);[[Lisa Riley]],([[1998]]-[[2002]]);[[Jonathan Wilkes]],([[2003]]);[[Harry Hill]],([[2004]]-present)\" \"[[Bruce Forsyth]] (1988-1990),[[Matthew Kelly]] (1991-1995),[[Darren Day]] (1996-1997)\" \"[[Groucho Marx]] [[George Fenneman]]\" \"[[Les Lye]] and [[#Cast|others]]\" \"[[Rodney Scott]][[Mark Famiglietti]][[Katherine Moennig]][[Ian Somerhalder]][[Kate Bosworth]]Ed Quinn\" \"Gene Wilder[[Teri Garr]][[Cloris Leachman]][[Marty Feldman]][[Peter Boyle]][[Madeline Kahn]][[Kenneth Mars]][[Gene Hackman]]\" \"''[[#Cast|See below]]''\" \"[[Sylvia Sidney]][[Henry Fonda]]\" \"New cast with each episode\" \"[[Freddie Prinze, Jr]][[Saffron Burrows]][[Matthew Lillard]][[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]][[Jurgen Prochnow]][[David Warner]]Ginny HolderHugh QuarshireKen BonesJohn McGlynnRichard DillaneMark ProwleyDavif Fahm[[Simon MacCorkindale]]Fraser James\" * There isn't an (or at least not that I could find!) obvious distinction between usage of properties like dbpedia:name, dbpedia:title, rdfs:label. In general, to find the title of a film one must try all three of these, and give them some kind of priority (e.g. I'm trying title first, then name, and finally label) * Those Films which do not have infoboxes on their wikipedia page appear to be missing rdfs:label, dbpedia:name, or dbpedia:title triples; this one might be a product of me only looking in the infoboxes.nt set of data, and the data might be available in articles.nt (I've not looked into this one in detail :) * Finally (although I'm told this is something of an ongoing issue, I'll include it for completeness' sake :), encoded URIs aren't always parsed correctly by the DBpedia server, particularly when asking for those with encoded colons, apostrophes, etc. They tend to make it either 404 or 500, with no discernable pattern. I'm guessing this is the same apache proxy issue you solved previously for encoded parentheses, so hopefully might be an easy fix! Hope some of this is helpful - and a big thanks for all the hard work that's gone into the DBpedia project!

"The Future Of Freebase in RDF"	"uStatus of Freebase in RDF in Q4 2012 I'd like to share the status of my :BaseKB effort to convert Freebase to RDF, its future, and how it relates to other efforts. (See This is a long letter, but the takeaway is that Iâm looking to put together some sort of a group to advance the development of :BaseKB, a product that converts Freebase data to logically sound RDF. If this interests you, keep reading. :BaseKB is the first and only complete and correct conversion of Freebase data to RDF. :BaseKB is possible because there is no fundamental philosophical difference between the Freebase data model and the RDF data model. Freebase spent $20 million or so developing graphd and the proprietary MQL language because they got started early, when SPARQL didnât exist and when there wasnât the vibrant competition between triple and quad store implementations that exists today. As a result of this early start, Freebase remains the worldâs leading data wiki by a large margin. For a long time, Freebase has made it possible to retrieve a limited fraction of information in RDF format at rdf.freebase.com; this service, for the most part, made it possible to retrieve triples sharing a specific subject, as well as a number of âRDF moleculesâ involving CVT and mediator types. The official RDF version of Freebase is of limited use for a few reasons: most significantly, it has never been possible to query it with SPARQL, and second, the practical limitations of running a public API mean that Freebase can only publish a limited number of triples for any given subject. Although only a small fraction of concepts in Freebase are affected by this limit, these highly connected nodes play a critical role in the graph. Any âtypicalâ graph algorithm will traverse these nodes and thus give unsound results. (To be fair, this is a general problem with the âdereferencingâ idea in Linked Data and not the fault of Freebase.) Last April I released the early access version of :BaseKB, the first complete and correct conversion of Freebase to RDF. :BaseKB was supplied as a set of n-Triples files that could be loaded into a triple store and queried with SPARQL 1.1. This early access release contained a subset of information from Freebase, including all schema objects, all concepts that exist in Wikipedia, and all CVTs that interconnect these concepts. :BaseKB was made available for free under a CC-BY just like Freebase. :BaseKB was designed to be a project both competitive and complementary to DBpedia. Anyone trying to do projects with DBpedia will discover that intensive data cleaning is usually necessary to get correct query answers. Freebaseâs mode of operation promises better curation than DBpedia and this translates into more correct answers with less data cleaning. Soon after, I announced the first release of :BaseKB Pro, a commercial product comprising all facts from Freebase, updated weekly on a subscription basis. :BaseKB Pro was not a commercial success. I didnât sell a single license. Around the time this project was launched, I accepted a really great job offer so Iâve had limited time to work on :BaseKB and related projects. Not long after :BaseKB was announced, Google announced plans to publish an official RDF dump for Freebase in Summer 2012. This was a welcome development, however, this announcement is one reason why :BaseKB development was on the back burner this summer. In this time Iâve been happy to hear about certain work on reification at Freebase and Iâve also seen that DBpedia and WikiData are both evolving in the correct directions. As of October, no RDF dump has been published by Freebase, and the information I have leads me to believe that we canât count on Google to provide a workable RDF dump of Freebase. Thus, Iâm beginning to reassess the competitive landscape and to reposition :BaseKB. I havenât followed the discussion list closely in the past few months, but I did see a report that a Google engineer had great difficulty loading a Freebase dump into a triple store and concluded this wasnât practical to do without an exotic and expensive computer with more than 64G of RAM. I donât know what data set was used, or what tools. I do know that I can easily load both :BaseKB and :BaseKB Pro on a Lenovo W520 laptop with 32 GB of RAM (bought from Crucial at a price much lower than OEM.) I demonstrated queries against :BaseKB Pro to individuals I met at the Semantic Technology Conference in San Francisco this July. Maybe itâs just hard to find good help these days. It takes me 1 hour to load :BaseKB into Virtuoso OpenLink on an older computer with 24 GB of RAM. I know the Franz people have loaded :BaseKB into Allegrograph and that others have loaded it into BigData. Unlike many popular RDF data sets, :BaseKB passes a test suite that includes a streaming version of Jena âeyeballâ for a high degree of compatibility with triple stores and other RDF tools. :BaseKB accomplishes a considerable level of compression relative to the quad dump and the (unusable) Linked Data representation. Nearly 8% of the quad dump consists of statements to the effect that all but a handful of objects are world writable. The Linked Data representation often uses two triples to represent what :BaseKB does in one, which results in hundreds of millions of triples of harmful overhead. Performance and compatibility with were baked into :BaseKB in the earliest stages of development. Iâd like to say that I had some special insight into the problem of converting Freebase data, but no, like a certain Winston Churchill quote, I discovered the correct way to do it only after exhausting all of the other alternatives. Iâm quite fortunate that I had some time where I could avoid the usual distractions involved with software projects and work out the math. One problem that bothered me early on was that I needed information from the schema to assign types to triples; if the schema told me that the object of a certain predicate was always an integer, I could use that to generate a triple with an integer object (that would sort, for instance, like an integer.) This process involved joining the predicate field with the subject of a quad in the schema field. However, a predicate like â/people/person/date_of_birthâ shows up as â/m/04m1â in the subject field. This seemed to be a âchicken and eggâ problem until I realized that, very simply, queries against Freebase work correctly when mid identifiers are used as primary keys. This has the disadvantage that the predicates are no longer machine readable, you have to write something like ?person fbase:m.04m1 ?date . in your SPARQL queries. Once I recognized that the problem of converting names in the dump to mids was the real problem, everything else was downhill. When you treat mids as primary queries, SPARQL queries give logically sound results against Freebase. The disadvantage of this, of course, is that queries are harder to write, but this is overcome by the basekb tools which rewrite names that appear in queries in the same way that the MQL query engine does. You can join other data sets to :BaseKB by grounding (smooshing) them through the tools. Alternatively, you can write OWL and RDFS statements that map Freebase predicates to well-known vocabularies like foaf. I think people have found this answer distasteful, so theyâve often tried to substitute âhuman readableâ identifiers for the mids. Perhaps somebody really can make that work, but itâs a harder problem than it seems at first glance. For instance, important predicates have more than one name and you have to support all of them. You might think owl:sameAs would help here but it doesnât, not with the standard interpretation. Itâs probably not hard to make something thatâs almost right but the QA work in making something âhalf-baked but good enoughâ is often vastly greater than that of making something perfect. I had to get the job done with a one-man army corp, so I used the simplest possible correct answer. I donât know it for a fact, but I think it is quite possible that the development of a Freebase RDF dump inside of Google may have taken a wrong turn somewhere. I put development of :BaseKB on hold in July for several reasons, one of which is that I failed to sell any subscriptions for the :BaseKB Pro product. Around this I also received a great job offer which I subsequently accepted, so I have had less time to work on projects of this sort. :BaseKB was clearly ahead of the market last July, but I think itâs time to develop partnerships that will keep it relevant. Planned monthly releases of the :BaseKB product did not materialize because I havenât had time to diagnose problems in the conversion process. For instance, one quad dump that I downloaded has a single quad in shard 13 that throws an exception in one processing stage, which causes the system to abort. Fixing this is a matter of downloading a recent quad dump and running it in the debugger; almost certainly itâs a very small problem. Somebody who wasnât so obsessive about data quality would probably be happy to just eat the exception and lose the quad. Similarly, I understand changes have been made in how descriptions are implemented in Freebase and this may allow the simplification of the system, which previously required a plurality of processing stages to merge in descriptions from the simple topic dump as well as use a web crawler to get descriptions from (occasionally) documented schema objects. Now things should be simpler. Iâm not able to maintain :BaseKB on a week by week basis, so Iâm looking to the community for help. Iâm working on a plan to put :BaseKB in the hands of people who can use it and Iâm considering options such as licensing the technology behind it or donating it to an Open Source project. To do either Iâll want to have a credible plan to make :BaseKB sustainable. Please write me at if you are interested. Iâll talk a bit about the software that creates :BaseKB. It all revolves around a framework called âInfovoreâ which is a RDF-centric Map/Reduce framework that runs in multiple threads on a single computer. The framework, at the moment, is designed for high efficiency at processing Freebase-scale data. Unlike triple-store based system, Infovoreâs streaming processing has minimal memory requirements. In fact, the most economical environment for running Infovore in AWS is a c1.medium instance with just 1.7 GB of RAM. It completes roughly 18 stages of processing in about 12 hours on a c1.medium to convert the contents of Freebase to correct RDF. I get better performance on my personal workstation, but operation and development of Infovore is very practical with the underpowered laptops that software developers seem to be stuck with so often. Infovore is written in Java and uses the Jena framework; reducers collect groups of statements together into models, upon which data transformations can be specified using SPARQL 1.1. Lately Iâve been working with much larger data sets in Hadoop and studying the Map/Reduce model used there and it seems very likely that the system could be made more scalable and clock time faster (at some increase in hardware cost per quad) by porting it to Hadoop. Iâve also considered adding support for Sesame and OWLIM-Lite which may give better performance and inference abilities. Infovore also contains a system for high-speed mapping of âhuman readableâ Freebase identifiers to mid identifiers and an system for applying space-efficient in-memory graph algorithms to do tasks such as correct pruning of the complete :BaseKB Pro into the much more usable :BaseKB. (One of the many contradictions in my business plan was that :BaseKB is a more commercially usable product than :BaseKB Pro. :BaseKB takes advantage of the policies of Wikipedia that lead to a much closer mapping between concepts in the system p.o.v. to concepts in the minds of end users than exists in Freebase as a whole.) The pruning algorithm is capable of creating other kinds of consistent subsets; if you want a database of concepts connected with professional wrestling or things that Shakespeare might have known about, this is not science fiction, itâs just what Infovore can do and you can tell it exactly what to do by writing SPARQL queries. I know many more people use SQL databases than use SPARQL databases today, and Infovore has a good answer for them. SPARQL queries give answers in a tabular format exactly like a SQL table, so itâs quite easy to define Freebase to relational mappings with SPARQL queries. In all, Infovore is a good answer to the high memory consumption of triple stores; by preprocessing RDF data to contain exactly you need before loading it into a triple store, you can handle large data sets and still enjoy the flexibility of SPARQL and RDF. So, if youâd like to see a and up-to-date correct conversion of Freebase to RDF now, rather than (possibly) never, send me an email.

Last April I released the early access version of :BaseKB, the first complete and correct conversion of Freebase to RDF. :BaseKB was supplied as a set of n-Triples files that could be loaded into a triple store and queried with SPARQL 1.1. This early access release contained a subset of information from Freebase, including all schema objects, all concepts that exist in Wikipedia, and all CVTs that interconnect these concepts. :BaseKB was made available for free under a CC-BY just like Freebase. :BaseKB was designed to be a project both competitive and complementary to DBpedia. Anyone trying to do projects with DBpedia will discover that intensive data cleaning is usually necessary to get correct query answers. Freebaseâs mode of operation promises better curation than DBpedia and this translates into more correct answers with less data cleaning. Soon after, I announced the first release of :BaseKB Pro, a commercial product comprising all facts from Freebase, updated weekly on a subscription basis. :BaseKB Pro was not a commercial success. I didnât sell a single license. Around the time this project was launched, I accepted a really great job offer so Iâve had limited time to work on :BaseKB and related projects. Not long after :BaseKB was announced, Google announced plans to publish an official RDF dump for Freebase in Summer 2012. This was a welcome development, however, this announcement is one reason why :BaseKB development was on the back burner this summer. In this time Iâve been happy to hear about certain work on reification at Freebase and Iâve also seen that DBpedia and WikiData are both evolving in the correct directions. As of October, no RDF dump has been published by Freebase, and the information I have leads me to believe that we canât count on Google to provide a workable RDF dump of Freebase. Thus, Iâm beginning to reassess the competitive landscape and to reposition :BaseKB. I havenât followed the discussion list closely in the past few months, but I did see a report that a Google engineer had great difficulty loading a Freebase dump into a triple store and concluded this wasnât practical to do without an exotic and expensive computer with more than 64G of RAM. I donât know what data set was used, or what tools. I do know that I can easily load both :BaseKB and :BaseKB Pro on a Lenovo W520 laptop with 32 GB of RAM (bought from Crucial at a price much lower than OEM.) I demonstrated queries against :BaseKB Pro to individuals I met at the Semantic Technology Conference in San Francisco this July. Maybe itâs just hard to find good help these days. It takes me 1 hour to load :BaseKB into Virtuoso OpenLink on an older computer with 24 GB of RAM. I know the Franz people have loaded :BaseKB into Allegrograph and that others have loaded it into BigData. Unlike many popular RDF data sets, :BaseKB passes a test suite that includes a streaming version of Jena âeyeballâ for a high degree of compatibility with triple stores and other RDF tools. :BaseKB accomplishes a considerable level of compression relative to the quad dump and the (unusable) Linked Data representation. Nearly 8% of the quad dump consists of statements to the effect that all but a handful of objects are world writable. The Linked Data representation often uses two triples to represent what :BaseKB does in one, which results in hundreds of millions of triples of harmful overhead. Performance and compatibility with were baked into :BaseKB in the earliest stages of development. Iâd like to say that I had some special insight into the problem of converting Freebase data, but no, like a certain Winston Churchill quote, I discovered the correct way to do it only after exhausting all of the other alternatives. Iâm quite fortunate that I had some time where I could avoid the usual distractions involved with software projects and work out the math. One problem that bothered me early on was that I needed information from the schema to assign types to triples; if the schema told me that the object of a certain predicate was always an integer, I could use that to generate a triple with an integer object (that would sort, for instance, like an integer.) This process involved joining the predicate field with the subject of a quad in the schema field. However, a predicate like â/people/person/date_of_birthâ shows up as â/m/04m1â in the subject field. This seemed to be a âchicken and eggâ problem until I realized that, very simply, queries against Freebase work correctly when mid identifiers are used as primary keys. This has the disadvantage that the predicates are no longer machine readable, you have to write something like ?person fbase:m.04m1 ?date . in your SPARQL queries. Once I recognized that the problem of converting names in the dump to mids was the real problem, everything else was downhill. When you treat mids as primary queries, SPARQL queries give logically sound results against Freebase. The disadvantage of this, of course, is that queries are harder to write, but this is overcome by the basekb tools way that the MQL query engine does. You can join other data sets to :BaseKB by grounding (smooshing) them through the tools. Alternatively, you can write OWL and RDFS statements that map Freebase predicates to well-known vocabularies like foaf. I think people have found this answer distasteful, so theyâve often tried to substitute âhuman readableâ identifiers for the mids. Perhaps somebody really can make that work, but itâs a harder problem than it seems at first glance. For instance, important predicates have more than one name and you have to support all of them. You might think owl:sameAs would help here but it doesnât, not with the standard interpretation. Itâs probably not hard to make something thatâs almost right but the QA work in making something âhalf-baked but good enoughâ is often vastly greater than that of making something perfect. I had to get the job done with a one-man army corp, so I used the simplest possible correct answer. I donât know it for a fact, but I think it is quite possible that the development of a Freebase RDF dump inside of Google may have taken a wrong turn somewhere. I put development of :BaseKB on hold in July for several reasons, one of which is that I failed to sell any subscriptions for the :BaseKB Pro product. Around this I also received a great job offer which I subsequently accepted, so I have had less time to work on projects of this sort. :BaseKB was clearly ahead of the market last July, but I think itâs time to develop partnerships that will keep it relevant. Planned monthly releases of the :BaseKB product did not materialize because I havenât had time to diagnose problems in the conversion process. For instance, one quad dump that I downloaded has a single quad in shard 13 that throws an exception in one processing stage, which causes the system to abort. Fixing this is a matter of downloading a recent quad dump and running it in the debugger; almost certainly itâs a very small problem. Somebody who wasnât so obsessive about data quality would probably be happy to just eat the exception and lose the quad. Similarly, I understand changes have been made in how descriptions are implemented in Freebase and this may allow the simplification of the system, which previously required a plurality of processing stages to merge in descriptions from the simple topic dump as well as use a web crawler to get descriptions from (occasionally) documented schema objects. Now things should be simpler. Iâm not able to maintain :BaseKB on a week by week basis, so Iâm looking to the community for help. Iâm working on a plan to put :BaseKB in the hands of people who can use it and Iâm considering options such as licensing the technology behind it or donating it to an Open Source project. To do either Iâll want to have a credible plan to make :BaseKB sustainable. Please write me at if you are interested. Iâll talk a bit about the software that creates :BaseKB. It all revolves around a framework called âInfovoreâ which is a RDF-centric Map/Reduce framework that runs in multiple threads on a single computer. The framework, at the moment, is designed for high efficiency at processing Freebase-scale data. Unlike triple-store based system, Infovoreâs streaming processing has minimal memory requirements. In fact, the most economical environment for running Infovore in AWS is a c1.medium instance with just 1.7 GB of RAM. It completes roughly 18 stages of processing in about 12 hours on a c1.medium to convert the contents of Freebase to correct RDF. I get better performance on my personal workstation, but operation and development of Infovore is very practical with the underpowered laptops that software developers seem to be stuck with so often. Infovore is written in Java and uses the Jena framework; reducers collect groups of statements together into models, upon which data transformations can be specified using SPARQL 1.1. Lately Iâve been working with much larger data sets in Hadoop and studying the Map/Reduce model used there and it seems very likely that the system could be made more scalable and clock time faster (at some increase in hardware cost per quad) by porting it to Hadoop. Iâve also considered adding support for Sesame and OWLIM-Lite which may give better performance and inference abilities. Infovore also contains a system for high-speed mapping of âhuman readableâ Freebase identifiers to mid identifiers and an system for applying space-efficient in-memory graph algorithms to do tasks such as correct pruning of the complete :BaseKB Pro into the much more usable :BaseKB. (One of the many contradictions in my business plan was that :BaseKB is a more commercially usable product than :BaseKB Pro. :BaseKB takes advantage of the policies of Wikipedia that lead to a much closer mapping between concepts in the system p.o.v. to concepts in the minds of end users than exists in Freebase as a whole.) The pruning algorithm is capable of creating other kinds of consistent subsets; if you want a database of concepts connected with professional wrestling or things that Shakespeare might have known about, this is not science fiction, itâs just what Infovore can do and you can tell it exactly what to do by writing SPARQL queries. I know many more people use SQL databases than use SPARQL databases today, and Infovore has a good answer for them. SPARQL queries give answers in a tabular format exactly like a SQL table, so itâs quite easy to define Freebase to relational mappings with SPARQL queries. In all, Infovore is a good answer to the high memory consumption of triple stores; by preprocessing RDF data to contain exactly you need before loading it into a triple store, you can handle large data sets and still enjoy the flexibility of SPARQL and RDF. So, if youâd like to see a and up-to-date correct conversion of Freebase to RDF now, rather than (possibly) never, send me an email. ( )"

If the engine is sufficiently removed from the Wikipedia scenario, ie, if it could be used on any MediaWiki dump, then it probably wouldn''t be classed as a derivative work. It depends on whether there is hard coded information in the software that relies on Wikipedia I guess as to whether it fits or not, but it is a vague area in many senses. According to the sourceforge project page [1], the engine is released into the Public Domain, but you would have to look at the individual files for their copyright notices to confirm that there aren't other licenses, and check the dependencies to make sure there are no viral dependencies, like GPL for instance. Public Domain is definitely not viral, but it is open source if people want to extend it and they choose to keep the Public Domain or use another open license.

I am concluding that DBpedia is released *both* on PD and under GPL. Is that corect? To be clear: you are free to release your code under the conditions you like but if you want to make a derivative work from GPLed software you have to release a \"copy\" (call it a \"version\") of your \"derivative work\" under GPL. This is true (AFAICT) for CC-SA licenses, also. Cristian p.s.: I am sorry to be late with my answer =). uHoi, When you use an application, it does not follow that the content becomes part of that license. It is perfectly ok to create proprietary fiction writing OpenOffice or conversely writing public domain fiction using MS/Word. The licensing of the material generated by DBpedia has Wikipedia as its origin and its content is now available under the CC-by-sa as well as GFDL. When you generate the DBpedia content, there are people who consider it to be a derivative and consequently the combo of licenses would be appropriate, there are also people who consider the process an abstraction of facts and this allows for a different approach. Facts as such cannot be licensed. As a collection facts can be licensed. However, given that the DBpedia software is available under a free license, claiming copyright on such a collection is problematic because everyone is invited to use the software and mutatis mutandis the resulting collection may be different. My personal belief is that the approach of making the facts Free is the right approach.

The original and most fitting example was \"a software for a navigator (like TomTom, for instance) which use information extracted from OSM\", logically this work does rely on OSM data but the software itself could hardly be considered a derivative work. I believe that DBpedia is in the same situation.

The first release of the system will focus about rules that apply to individual triples, but its not a difficult extension of that to build something that only copies records where the subjects are kings and queens, about sealing wax, whatever. As a rough idea of costs and time involved, it takes around two hours, $2 in transfer cost and about $1 in CPU to package the dump for EMR. It will take more EMR costs to clean the data up and probably compress it to speed up your Qs A somewhat tuned system could deliver you a custom subset of DBpedia in an hour or two on a cluster that costs about as much to run as a minimum wage employee.

From: Dan Gravell Sent: Monday, July 15, 2013 9:34 AM To: Subject: [Dbpedia-discussion] Strategies to download subsets of DBPedia What is the most efficient (CPU and network time) of extracting subsets of DBPedia? I am only interested in and the first level of relationships. First, I want to work on the data dumps provided either by DBPedia or Wikipedia (via the extraction framework, maybe). I realise I could do what I want via - It adds load on dbpedia.org - dbpedia.org often appears to have maintenance periods - There are limits placed on the number of results from dbpedia.org However, the DBPedia dumps themselves have one big problem: they are so massive it appears to take days to do anything with them. Loading them into Apache Jena for instance takes ages. I also tried a little sed'ing and awk'ing of the file but with little success. How is everyone else dealing with subsets of the data dumps? Is it possible to configure the extraction framework to ignore input records, or maybe output to something other than text n-tuples which would then be easier to slice and dice (e.g. output to SQL, then perform a query?).

Best, Dimitris [1] [2] uThanks Dimitris. I'm making fairly good progress right now by simply brute forcing a few scans over the .nt file and filtering out the lines of interest. On a consumer grade SSD this takes about 7 minutes per scan, and as this is a batch, non-interactive nor user facing job, this is acceptable. I hope to write up and maybe publish what I've done (my awk/sed skills fall short so I ended up scripting something in Scala).

"Caching headers"	"uDear all, I did a survey on the prevalence of HTTP cache headers on SPARQL Endpoint responses, and reported the results at ISWC last week. They weren't too good, even though quite a few expose them. As Webarch says \"Dereferencing a URI has a (potentially significant) cost in computing and bandwidth resources, may have security implications, and may impose significant latency on the dereferencing application. Dereferencing URIs should be avoided except when necessary.\" Since, the endpoint doesn't give any guideance to the application in terms of headers, it has to be derefenced, often needlessly. Since SPARQL is fairly heavy to evaluate, I'm sure you are very aware of the costs. Caching could most certainly be exploited for many SPARQL queries, especially for DBPedia, since the database changes infrequently. I previously posted an email to the developer's mailing list, but Ted informed me this would be a better forum. So, here's what should be done, in order of priority: 1) Set a Cache-Control header, e.g.: Cache-Control: max-age=2678400 This says the response is fresh for a month after the request. The value should be as long as possible, but not longer. :-) Meaning, if you know that you will not release another release in the next 8 months, you should add the number corrresponding to how many seconds there are in 8 months. Nearing the release, the value must be reduced. I suggest a month is a reasonable default figure, it will enable a lot of caching, but also allow you to plan updates within a month. Once the release date is known, it should count down towards that. At that point, it should also probably add must-revalidate also. 2) Set the Last-Modified header. The Last-Modified header is simply when the last DBPedia release was made. 3) Be able to respond with a 304 HTTP code if the client asks for revalidation with If-Modified-Since. Now, I don't know how dbpedia.org/sparql is configured, beyond that it runs Virtuoso and is maintained by Openlink. If you tell me a bit about how HTTP headers in general are added to the setup, I might be able to help with the specifics. If the above is done, it would also enable the use of a \"HTTP accelerator\", such as Varnish: as well. It would also enable institutional caching proxies, so that when everyone at Insight has to use DBPedia to launch the same queries meet their deadlines, the request doesn't need to go all the way to DBPedia. ;-) I've just started my research in this area. The rest of the Web uses this extensively, and it is quite likely that the above simple measures would benefit significantly, but my ambition is to provide more extensive benefits, both in terms of taking load off endpoints and to speed up client-percieved responses, based on prefetching. So, it'll help my research too :-) Cheers, Kjetil uOn 10/30/14 6:41 PM, Kjetil Kjernsmo wrote: Kjetil, This is a trivial matter. What isn't always trivial is receipt of constructive feedback (like this) from folks using the service. Ditto, our penchant for sometimes forgetting to atomize settings in our VAD packages.

K uOn 11/11/2011 13:39, kevin carter wrote: I'm saying nothin' . Just trying to get a sense of what would be useful for you. One obvious point is that a Wikipedia page needs to be authoritative on the subject it is addressing. As such, if you put up a page for N19 4EH, it can't just be a vehicle for your own video, and would probably involve more work than you would want to put in. I think a better approach would be to think of embedding some Linked Data directly in your own pages: RDFa is a popular way of doing this (I'm told). This Linked Data would say \"this is a video; it depicts/islocated in postcode area X\" (where X would be the Ordnance Survey URL for the postcode in question). And maybe some other useful metadata about the video. Then you can just wait for the semantic spiders to come and find your site. Richard uRichard, I appreciate your candor. Your approach sounds good. Currently the video is hosted on a proprietory video/web server and there is a requirement to move this. My plan was to migrate the video content to Wikipedia under a Public Realm License, create a set of linked Wikipedia pages which would then be included within the next DBpedia grab. So a better plan might be, move the video archive to a server within the public realm (suggestions ?) then build pages around the content that includes RDF/Metadata, and as you say wait for the bots. In this way side stepping the need to submit content via Wikipedia ? As for promoting my own video yep WP are rightly very clear on that. The point about the project is I did not make any of the videos, I just set up the software tools/server and invited people to record their own views on themselves, their community etc, so in that sense I hope I doesn't feel to much like self promotion, more an attempt to engage with the possibilities of community based technologies.

"Split the articles dataset"	"uHi all, I think we should split the articles dataset: Articles (224 MB, 12 Mtriple) - descriptions of all 1.6 million concepts within the English version of Wikipeida with English titles and English abstracts, thumbnails, Wikipedia links. This is the dbpedia basis file which should be loaded into each dbpedia repository. Some people just might want the titles, the abstracts, the thumbnails or the links. The titles might stay the primary dataset. I think to require people to load GB of data creates a severe hurdle. u uSören, On 14 Mar 2007, at 15:32, Sören Auer wrote: Good point. What do you think, is the bigger hurdle the pure size of the dump in bytes, or is it the number of triples? If it's the size, then separating the English abstracts out into a separate dump should help a lot, they are the 20% of the triples that cause 80% of the byte size (very rough guess).

Note that, among other problems, those axioms imply that each MusicGenre is a GovernmentType and vice versa, that each Year is a Holiday and vice versa, etc. Moreover, some classes, such as MusicGenre, become unsatisfiable when the DUL/D0 ontologies are used in a reasoner.

BTW in the original mappings for version 3.9 those axioms were all subClassOf. Probably something has gone weird in the versioning. My proposal, which I made two years ago, is that, since DOLCE mappings have the main goal to help integrity checking or top-level querying, they should be revised shortly before each new DBpedia ontology release, so that no incoherences are accidentally introduced in the release. In fact, even with 3.9, some changes were made to the ontology after I sent out the mappings, and some (just a few) axioms, which were defined with unions, were removed, probably because unions were not intended to be enforced in DBpedia. In absence of a clear management of top level mappings, I still hesitate to update them, although there is a clear need to do it. Cheers Aldo u(cc'ing the DBpedia ontology list) Thank you Heiko for identifying the inconsistencies a big thank to Aldo for taking the effort of creating the original mappings. personally, I am not aware of any changes to the mappings (subClassOF / equivalentClass/Property) but I was not so involved in the releases before 2015-04 Markus and I have the overview of the current releases but we are not dolce experts and not sure how to proceed here. They way I see it we need 2 things here: 1) identifying the errors & 2) fixing them looks like Heiko has something wrt (1) that we can reuse for the following release. We need help with (2) though. If the mapping flexibility is an issue I would suggest to keep these mappings out of the mappings wiki. We plan to move the ontology out of the wiki as well when we switch to RML so it is something we will do anyway Any other suggestions / feedback?

"dbpedia uri encoding policy: conflating URIrefs and URIs?"	"uHi folks, (apologies in advance for a rather longwinded post) I have a comment regarding the URI encoding policy as defined at Specifically, it says this: 'All other characters are unsafe and are first converted into one or more bytes using UTF-8 encoding. Then each byte is represented by the 3-character string \"%xy\", where xy is the two-digit hexadecimal representation of the byte.' This policy results in DBPedia RDF containing URIrefs like: This is a valid URI, but it seems to me that DBpedia's definition of 'unsafe characters' is slightly too broad, and more importantly, that the current policy is jumbling the notions of URIs and URI /references/. RDF uses URI references[1]. These should not contain %-encoded chars themselves, but are defined to be valid Unicode strings that would result in a valid URI *after encoding is applied*. How 'unsafe' characters in URIrefs should be escaped or encoded is a feature of a particular RDF serialization format. For example, in N-Triples all URIref chars that are not in the US-ASCII range are encoded using \-escape sequences (see [2]). However, since '(' and ')' are in fact US-ASCII chars, there is no need to encode/escape these chars in a URIref in N-Triples (nor, AFAIK, in any other of the more common RDF serialization formats). The reason I am raising this point is that there may be a real problem when clients read the RDF produced by DBPedia: RDF processors, if spec-conformant, assume that what they get back is a URI reference, and that they may need to %-encode it to produce a valid URI. However, since DBPedia produces URIrefs that already contain %-encodings, such a processor would apply %-encoding twice (since % itself is a character that needs to be encoded): In other words: an RDF processor will, under the current policy, not be able to distinguish between a URI containing a %-encoded character and a URIref containing the %-character itself. To make a long story short: I believe the DBPedia RDF should contain URIrefs like this: and it should leave the %-encoding up to the client. Regards, Jeen [1] [2] #sec-uri-encoding uHi Jeen, you raise a point that many DBpedians have on their minds. Double-encoded percent signs and decreased readability are popular arguments for %-encoding less characters. Especially because some of them are in fact not \"unsafe\" (I deleted this statement on [1]). However, as stated on the referenced page, the encoding of URIs is modeled after the encoding of Wikipedia identifiers. And I am not sure if diverging from this scheme is a good idea.

But consider this: the Wikipedia identifier encoding scheme is about encoding URIs, not URI *references*. The change I propose would still be compatible with that, all I'm saying is that the things that appear in the DBPedia RDF should be URI references, not (%-encoded) URIs. If anything, it would be _more_ compatible with Wikipedia that way, not less. Regards, Jeen"
"DBpedia content not valid RDF/XML"	"uHi, all of these errors stem from the problem that not all RDF triples can be represented in RDF/XML. [1] (IMHO, a shortcoming in the RDF/XML spec that could easily have been fixed by introducing something like , similar to .) As Jeen Broekstra wrote on dbpedia-discussion in August 2011 [2]: \"The only reliable way around the problem is to use a serialization format that does cope with all legal RDF properly, such as N-Triples or Turtle.\" But still, when someone really wants RDF/XML, what should Virtuoso do with triples that can't be serialized? In some cases, there actually is a possible representation. For example, the property URI could be represented as Weird and confusing for humans, no problem for computers. In those cases that can't be represented in RDF/XML, the spec says 'throw a \"this graph cannot be serialized in RDF/XML\" exception or error' [1]. Probably not a good solution for us. I think Virtuoso should omit such triples from RDF/XML, but include something like a comment in their place that they were omitted and are available in other formats (like NTriples).

"Easiest way to translate mappings?"	"uHello again, I've registered at mappings.dbpedia.org with the account name dbchris and would request editor rights, if not already given.

So far I could only search for specific mappings I want to edit, but ideally I would like to search for all mappings that have'nt been translated yet. If thats not possible I'll just edit the dbpedia-3.7.owl. Can I upload the file afterwards anywhere? uHi Chris, a big welcome to DBpedia! I just gave you editor rights. I guess that by translating you mean the labels for classes, properties and datatypes. There currently is no list of missing labels. It would be relatively easy to add a page to the DBpedia server (the one that extracts samples, displays the statistics etc.) that displays missing labels for a certain language. Maybe just an hour or two of workjust go through all ontology items, check if they have a label for the desired language, and display a link to their wiki pages. I won't have time to do that in the next two weeks or so (maybe later). But if you know a little Scala, you can easily do it yourself, and I'll gladly help you with any questions. The ontology and the labels have to be edited directly in the wiki. There is no way to edit the OWL file and upload the result to the mappings wiki, and it would be very hard to add that feature. You can easily download all ontology items from the wiki to one file and edit that file, but you can't upload the result, so that won't help either. It would probably be possible to somehow allow uploading that file, but while not as hard as handling the OWL file it's still a good deal of work and has some problems, so I don't think we're going to implement that.

"Existing entities vs General entities"	"uHello, for research purposes I'm interested in differentiating DBpedia entities into two types, those which are actual existing elements (i.e., things you can see and touch) and generalizations of elements (i.e., things which are abstractions of existing elements). Examples of the first ones could be: John Turturro, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Enola Gay bomber. Examples of generalizations could be: Football, the femur, Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber. After reading some documentation on the DBpedia, including the latest article published, it looks to me that such difference is never made. Furthermore I wonder if it is even possible to make that difference based on the information available. Unfortunately, I do not know enough about the Wikipedia semantics to answer that. The only solution I can think of is manually tagging entities. That could be facilitated by grouping elements (e.g., every entity of class Person is an existing entity). However, other classes would require individual treatment. So my questions are these: -Is there a difference in DBpedia between existing entities and general entities? -Is there information available in the Wikipedia to make such difference? -Based on the DBpedia, is there any other method beyond manual tagging to make that difference? -Of the DBpedia Ontology, which classes could be considered as holding existing entities? Person, Place, Planet, Work, ? I know is quite an abstract question, and not fully related with technical aspects of the DBpedia, but I think this is the place to ask.

If one were interested in converting DBpedia facts to text or creating a user interface, it would be good to know about \"abstract\" vs \"concrete\" There is the possibility of defining classes (:SomethingThatCanHaveAMember) or (:SomethingThatIsOnlyAnInstance) but also the possibility of defining an abstract/concrete score which is numerical. People tend to be very concrete, but we have no idea who :D.B._Cooper was or what his fate was. :Captain_Kirk is more abstract than :William_Shatner. When dealing with the more difficult stuff, a numeric score might be the best you can do. I think the strategy of starting with types and then refining the results is best. You could probably get a large majority of topics properly typed, particularly if you use type information from Freebase, which is more accurate and comprehensive than DBpedia types. The hard ones are going to be the things that fall through the cracks in the type system, like but note that Freebase has 18 types for this topic, so you're not without hope. Maybe it's a fair guess to say that \"things that fall through the cracks\" are abstract. I say: try the obvious thing with types, then do some evaluation. If you're not happy with it, maybe you'll think of another heuristic (traditional knowledge engineering) or maybe you can train a machine learning algorithm to make the distinction. Evaluate again and repeat until you've got enough for a paper or a product that's \"good enough to use\". I'd love to see a Turtle file published with these classifications because I could use them. uHi Paul, I agree. From my point of view, concrete entities have a different nature than abstract entities, which justifies the fact of using them differently. Those differences have been discussed for thousands of years (see Aristotle for example), and we should not ignore all that previous work. I may be naive in that matter, but I think that this subject is one of the keys for the success of the Semantic Web and for the field of AI in general. To be honest, I had not thought about a numeric value of abstractness before. Although it may be useful in practice (I'll have to think about that), I do not think it is 'natural'. As I see it, it would be more like a measure of ignorance. For example, your neighbor. Imagine you have never seen him, but you know he's a man because you have heard his voice. He is however a concrete entity for sure. The issue here is that your ignorance towards that entity causes you to generalize with him and treat him, in some aspects, like an abstract entity. You would assume he has two eyes, for example. That's a topic that also interests me and which falls within my PhD, since my main interest is to make knowledge discovery based on some Semantic Web. Thanks for the advice. It seems that Freebase is a little more specific in that difference than DBpedia. I'll study their data sets in detail. There are several approaches to solve this problem. Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, OntologiesNon of which has worked well enough so far. My proposed solution, which I have not seen anyone else trying, uses inference methods to discover and learn about entities. I'd say its a mix of DM, ML and Ont. But I need some data to start with. Freebase or DBpedia may just be it. Hopefully in one or two years you will have your Turtle file. Dario."

Thanks and Regards Amit uHi Pablo, Amit, Although I didn't write the image extractor, I think that this is more a matter of semantics than technical and it was left this way intentionally. The first picture is usually the most representative of the article and thus we use foaf:depiction. Other pictures might not be about the article itself, but for other closely related articles i.e. [1,2,3] so it might not be the best approach to extract them all. We do have the download.scala for wikipedia dumps, but the DIEF Wrapper would be great! One script to invoke them all ;) Anyway, I guess you have a reason to do it this way, but the DBpedia live approach could make more sense for a continuous integration.

While it's on our wiki, I just changed schema:duration from ObjectProperty to DatatypeProperty. It has range schema.org/Duration, which because of the capital D looks like a class, but is actually a datatype that looks equivalent to xsd:duration.

How can I connect my data to dbpedia sparql endpoint? Or, if it's impossible, how to start my own sparql endpoint? Thank you very much! uYou can definitely put up your own SPARQL endpoint with your own facts. The DBpedia SPARQL endpoint is it's own thing, hosting data from the DBpedia project and not a place where everybody can upload their facts. If you want to query both of them together, you could load them all into one database. This is not that hard to do if you want to make queries themselves, although the cost and effort to run a large public SPARQL endpoint can get pretty high. I think most of the time people are not really interested in the whole graph but rather in some piece of it, so a common pattern use is to copy facts from various sources into a Jena model or dataset and query that. A large number of approaches to federated querying have been tried, ranging from the standard where this is done explicitly.

"How can I extract information from wikipedia comparison tables?"	"uExample: I want to choose software project management tool (with issue tracking). I found plenty of information on pages: Comparison of issue-tracking systems and Comparison of project management software. The problem is that it's not convenient to select tool using 10 tables. I want to write something like SQL query and find all matches. I know about DBpedia which offers SPARQL interface, but as I understand it, it extracts information only from infoboxes and categories, so it lacks information about specific features which are described in comparison tables, not in infoboxes. I actually wrote small script (on Python) which parses on fly several wikipedia tables saved as CSV files and applies filters. With it I found that I have to choose between Redmine, Bloodhound, , but I don't like this approach because it's completely not universal and limited. Does anybody has suggestions how to extract information from wikipedia comparison tables in a \"right way\"?"

Jean uHi Jean, In general, there is no real standard way to fill in infobox values. It can contain numbers, links and even other templates. This lack of regularity makes parsing it a pain. For example, in English, the field is filled like this: |lat_deg = 50 |lat_min = 44 |lat_sec = 02.37 |lon_deg = 7 |lon_min = 5 |lon_sec = 59.33 While in German, it is like this: |Breitengrad = 50/44/02.37/N |Längengrad = 7/5/59.33/E There seems to exist already a GeoCoordinates parser in the DEF, that gets triggered when you use GeocoordinatesMapping instead of a PropertyMapping. You would probably have to extend the GeoCoordinateParser to include this new way to express lat/log Or you can try to convince Jona to extend it for you. :) Cheers, Pablo PS: This answer was written with help from Anja, Robert and Jona.

"how to register a RDF into DBPedia"	"uDear All; How are you? I am a kind of beginner for DBPedia. I am wondering a way to register a RDF (geopolitical ontology which contains country and region information) into DBPedia. I have the URL for it. It is an OWL format, but we can change into RDF. Is there any good reference or site for describing a way to register? Thanks for your answer in advance. : ) Best Regards, Soonho Kim uHello, I'm not quite sure, what do you mean by register. In general, it is sufficient to include outgoing links in your data set to DBpedia. e.g. fao#organization owl:equivalentClass db-owl:Organization . or fao:Togo owl:sameAs db-owl:Togo . Another way could be to include a schema class mapping into the wiki, but this is currently untested (I'm not sure if we allow to set equivalentClasses to arbitrary namespaces or just a whitelist, as this is prone to ontology hijacking ). If you cover a large domain of topics included in Wiki/DBpedia like person, movies, medicine it might make sense to include backlinks to your data set in DBpedia directly. If this is the case, please send us the links you created. Now that I think of it, it would make sense to have a portal, where we everybody could upload there mappings to and from DBpedia. It would need to have a revision system, so people could keep their mappings up to date. Has anybody heard of such a system, where third parties can upload links, which are then published?

The only database experience I have is with mySQL and phpMyAdmin so please bear with my beginner's questions.

Lastly, and most importantly, are there free alternatives to Virtuoso for triple stores/SPARQL execution? I've read in the same thread that Luis Stevens has an alternative.

"URLs that aren t cool"	"uYes, such as and I agree that this can be annoying. One have to make sure to not lose the case information (as it happened to me with lookup.dbpedia.org once, hence merging FROG and Frog). But what do you suggest to do about that, Paul? Should Wikipedia make URLs case-insensitive and then enforce disambiguation with ()? Best, Georgi uGeorgi Kobilarov wrote: If (wikipedia) were my site, I'd do two things: (i) map all case-variant forms to a single form (New yOrK cITy -> New York City;) \"FROG\" gets renamed to \"FROG Cipher\" or \"Frog (Cipher)\" (ii) do a permanent redirect from variant forms to the canonical form I think what dbpedia is doing is reasonable considering the situation. My own system for handling generic databases has both a VARBINARY and VARCHAR field for dbpedia URLs/labels. It does a case-insensitive lookup first, and if that fails, looks at the alternatives that turn up. It's also got some heuristics for dealing with redirects, disambiguation, and all that. In the big picture I see \"naming and identity\" as a specific functional module for this kind of system uIt's a stretch for MediaWiki but this kind of topic went through my head when I was thinking how I'd model my own wiki engine. Personally I'd drop the 1 to 1 Title <=> Blob relation (where blob is either page text, or text indicating a redirect to another title with a blob). My thoughts have been more like: - Title: The visual representation of the title; ie: What shows up in the tag and the - Name: Multiple identifiers which can be used to refer to the page. (ie: One of the possible things you'd type in the url to get to the page) A page would probably have a primary name which the secondary names would redirect to. (Likely just the first name in the list) The equivalent to adding a set of \"redirects\" would be editing the page, and adding a few more \"names\". The equivalent to moving a page would be editing the page, and replacing one of the names with another. My thoughts on disambiguation and cases like Frog and FROG were: 1) When looking for a page first the engine would look for case-sensitive matches and if one is found return that page. 2) If multiple exact matches are found then a automatic disambig page is returned, unless one of those pages have been marked as the primary page for that specific name, in which case that primary page is used instead. 3) If no matches are found, a case-insensitive match is looked for. 4) In this case if multiple case insensitive matches are found it compares them and uses the one which is more case similar. 5) Otherwise if the multiples share the same name then it follows the same as 2) for exact matches 6) Falls back to a \"Did you mean\", \"or you could create this page>\" kind of page. A) Pages with ambiguous names have links to the disambig pages on them; or in the case of a single ambiguity just a link to that page. Basically, for pages like \"Ownership\" which have no terms to disambiguate could be reached by /ownership /OWNERSHIP /Ownership, etcif the name \"Ownership\" was used. But for pages like \"Frog\" and \"FROG\" if the page on the frog species used the name \"Frog\" while the page on the FROG Cypher used the name \"FROG\". Then /Frog would point to the frog species page, /FROG would point to the FROG Cypher page because it's a case match. And /frog would point to the frog species page because it is more case similar to \"Frog\". And both Frog and FROG would have ambiguity links pointing to each other. The system would probably have a bit of hinting while editing about pagename ambiguities, and would have report pages for things like \"pages with only an ambiguous name\" (ie: Say Frog and FROG both used the name \"frog\" and used no other name; This would force the system to always display a disambig page and have to do something like using a page uid to refer the pages; These would be listed so they could be fixed) ~Daniel Friesen (Dantman, Nadir-Seen-Fire) [ Paul Houle wrote:"

I've written some scripts to automate the process and I can also set it up or guide you trough it. If you are the maintainer of a DBpedia language chapter, you can request an OAI proxy access from Dimitris. The approach with the Incremental Dumps is intriguing since it doesn't require access to the OAI-PMH stream which would enable a lot of people to host experimental clones of the system. However we might get a lot more extraction errors using it: \"*Here's the big fat disclaimer.* /This service is experimental./ At any time it may not be working, for a day, a week or a month. It is not intended to replace the full XML dumps. We don't expect users to be able to construct full dumps of a given date from the incrementals and an older dump. We don't guarantee that the data included in these dumps is complete, or correct, or won't break your Xbox. In short: don't blame us (but do get on the email list and send mail: see xmldatadumps-l ).\" I don't know if anyone tried using the incremental dumps, I didn't know they existed, this service seems to be quite new. The extraction framework should actually work out of the box with these dumps, either with the dump extraction or by packing the dumps in a mediawiki instance and calling the live extraction.

"Inconsistency Feedback from DBpedia to Wikipedia What's disjoint in the dbpedia ontology?"	"uHi all Indeed. And it should stay that way, and of course it is bound to be globally inconsistent forever, as Wikipedia is and will continue to be. There is no way it could be otherwise, since collective knowledge is inconsistent passed a certain scope and size. And this is IMHO rather a good thing. The perspective of a globally consistent view of the world is really a totalitarian nightmare! Even each of our individual knowledge(s) is inconsistent, I guess. At least so is mine. :-) So what is DBpedia ontology good for? Obviously for (partial) use in data linking and integration, but certainly not for building a global consistent view of the world à la Cyc. But a potential benefit of reasoning on this ontology, and maybe the most interesting one in the long run, is to explicit inconsistencies and feed them back to Wikipedia curators (as has been said, with all due diplomacy to Wikipedia work). Editors down there are often very well aware of inconsistencies, they are often pointed in discussion pages, for instance, decisions about it might be pending due to edition wars etc. But pinpointing them by expliciting the semantics does help. Some inconsistencies can be obvious errors or categorisation, like putting a place in a \"person\" category, but I guess many (most) of them actually point to things not yet clearly defined, or about which conflicting ontologies coexist. In such cases, they are topics about which knowledge is in the making, very often the most interesting ones! Maybe it could be suggested to Wikipedians to create a category \"Logically Inconsistent\", to mark those articles and categories. This shows at Web scale what I experience daily in data migration to semantic environments. Even if, as often happens, the resulting system do not meet the initial expectations, a side effect is in any case to have people look closely at their data and vocabulary for the necessary semantic sanity check, and this is very useful per se. If you ask me, even more useful than the system implemented, which is bound to have a very short life cycle anyway, as we all know. As Bruno Bachimont uses to say, an ontology is mainly a tool to explicit inconsistencies of our knowledge, pointing to new questions for research. After that, you can throw it away. :-) When the ontology is consistent, you have nothing to discover any more. Trying by all means to hide or wipe out inconsistencies is based on some paranoid logician's view of the world, similar to those who did not want to look into Galileo's telescope because sunspots, Moon's mountains and Jupiter's satellites were not mentioned in Aristote and the Bible Cheers"

"Help with Getting started and already available answering engine projects"	"uHi, I'm a student from India. I am very excited about the future of linked data and how DBpedia can make that dream come true. I've been reading a bit about semantic web from the book \"Semantic web primer \" . I want to create a \"Semantic answering engine\", where I get answers for the questions and not links, which the traditional search engines give. Eg: 1) Who are the musicians who were born in Chennai,India. 2) Where did Abraham Lincoln die? 3) Give me the capital of all states in India Only before a few days, I heard from my friend that there are already a lot of semantic answering engines that are already available. Despite of already available semantic engines I also want to develop my own \"semantic answering engine\". And I want to work on the output of the data, more of data visualization, with graphs and charts using javascript. I think DBpedia is the right place to get started to realize my idea.

"Hello World"	"uHi there, I would like to know about support of edit history in the dbpedia, that would be a key feature. Specifically I would like to try and partition a group of user into two parts, ones that introduce a tag/term to an article and ones who remove it. I have experimented with using git to analyse the wikihistory but it was very difficult on the text level. I was wondering what support dbpedia would have on such an analysis and at what detail level. Sorry that I have not read the fine docs or searched much, I figured that asking might provide the best answer anyway. thanks, mike uHi Mike, the 'dump' version of DBpedia currently does not include code to analyze article history. We usually do not even download the files that include the history of an article, we only us the current version. I think the 'live' version of DBpedia includes some history data, but I don't know much about that. The guys from Leipzig should be able to help. :-) The parser included in DBpedia tokenizes the source code of a Wikipedia page, but is mostly aimed at structured data and does not analyze the text. If I understand correctly, you need some kind of tool that analyzes the textual differences between article versions and groups users by these differences. I am afraid there is not much that DBpedia can help you with. All, please correct me if I'm wrong. Particularly, DBpedia spotlight analyzes the unstructured text - how about that?

In Malaria the infobox points to a diseasedb reference (7728) can I follow that somehow to get the cause of malaria as a URI, and can that URI be used usefully with dbpedia?

"Making Your LInked Data Discoverable"	"uAll, Over the years there has been a subtle \"blind spot\" re. Linked Data that ultimately leads to many a debate thread about Linked Data utility and applications etcThus, I would like to outline a few simple best practices that would go a long way to putting these reoccurring issues to rest, once and for all. Whenever you publish an (X)HTML based Linked Data interface please try to achieve at least one of the following: 1. Use Linked Data URIs in @href attribute of the tag associated with the literal values that typically label the subject, predicate, or object of an RDF triple. 2. Use the tag's @rel attribute to associate the (X)HTML document with Linked Data URIs of entities it describes or simply mentions (casually or topically). 3. If you have server access and admin level privileges, repeat #2 on the server side using the \"Link:\" header in HTTP responses . Irrespective of how subjectively beautiful or ugly an (X)HTML interface might be re., Linked Data display, the utility of your Linked Data is ultimately comprised if it cannot be discovered, shared, and easily referenced to by other Linked Data tools.

"Powerset: Semantic extraction from Wikipedia based on natural language"	"uPowerset is a new natural language search engine. In their demo, they are extracting structured information from Wikipedia not from infoboxes, but from the article text! Here's a short intro: Powermouse is a window into Powersets natural language index. When Powerset reads sentences in Wikipedia, we go from open text to representations of meaning. In other words, we take text and turn it into structured facts. When users enter a query into Powermouse, theyll be able to browse the facts stored in our index. In the example below, when wrestling star Hulk Hogan is entered in the first something box, users can see all of the facts weve indexed about him. Now, if you add defeat into the connection box, users see all of the facts that weve indexed from Wikipedia about wrestlers that Hogan has defeated. Heres a Hulk Hogan screenshot. In addition to showing off the power of our index, Powermouse also shows a different type of interface thats possible with a natural language index. Here are some example queries from their site: \"what did Steve Jobs say about Apple?\" \"who criticized Google?\" who acquired Peoplesoft? who manufactures CPUs? \"what did Mozart compose?\" \"what did Andy Warhol paint?\" \"who depicted urban life?\" I shamelessly attached some screencasts from the beta section.

"template parsing bug"	"uHello, There is an issue with SimpleWikiParser in extraction framework regarding template parsing. Strangely formatted templates like this one: {{template | value |= }} are not parsed as templates nodes but text nodes instead. Apart from preventing data extraction it results in incorrect abstracts on Polish Dbpedia. For example on parameter values. BTW, I noticed a couple of issues I when trying to report this issue. 1) I couldn't submit a bug on SourceForge at permission denied error. Is there any reason to restrict bug reporting to project members only? 2) I wanted to created a test case for it but I couldn't find any tests for the parser part in the repository. Are there any?

What I did however may be different from what you suspect though. Here's what I did: - I saw that you invoke api.php of local MediaWiki instance to parse wiki text. I didn't bother to set it up so I just replaced the URL with actual Wikipedia instance of the language I worked on. This caused the wiki text to be rendered with templates substituted. - After this modification I parsed wiki text from XML database dump using SimpleWikiParser and passed the PageNode to getAbstractWikiText method in modified AbstractExtractor - I saw that the returned text contains HTML markup so I removed it using an HTML sanitizer. I assumed that you use \"modified\" MediaWiki to cover this part but I wasn't sure. - I was not happy with short method in AbstractExtractor because it didn't recognize sentence boundaries correctly. I created my own shortening routine using java.text.BreakIterator with additional abbreviations checks. From what you're saying below I suspect that you are interested in generating abstracts without a need to invoke MediaWiki neither locally nor remotely. That I haven't tried to do.

Ranking them is important so the user is not overwhelmed. Also, you have limited space or displaying them. That's probably want was meant here with this selection of ~10 persons born in Paris. u@Nicolas, Yes, we are limiting sets. We have a radial layout, with limited screen real estate, so we have no intention to display 1000's of nodes. Just a dozen max per category should be enough for people to have something interesting to explore. We may use Wikipedia traffic volume to choose which subsets to display. @Tom: Thanks for your thoughts about comparing DBpedia and Freebase. Sorry our app is only iOS now. Yes, all browser-type apps (e.g., Wikipedia) are now 17+ rating. I'm all about free speech, but I'm actually supportive of parents/schools having a practical way to limit downloads that can display objectionable content. In practice I hope this is only enforced for young kids. Apple need policies which apply broadly, and it's not fair to hold Wikipedia to a different standard than any other broad-topic information database or browser. We actually have an additional profanity filter, but that did not help us get our 17+ rating lowered. @Kingsley: Our app will work offline, so we will need to create packages. We probably will not send users to DBpedia in realtime. Also, we are merging and massaging results. e.g., to filter from 1000's of hits to the top 10. @Anyone: If you'd like to see our WikiNodes app, and you have an iPad, send me a note off this list, and I can send you a promo code.

For example: \"Britney_Spears\" and \"Christina_Aguilera\" are related in that they both make similar kind of music. \"BMW\" and \"Mercedes-Benz\" are related since they are both car makers and companies from the same country and they have \"similar\" type of brands (\"BMW\" and \"Porche\" should ideally be less related than \"BMW\" and \"Mercedes-Benz\"). \"Microsoft\" and \"Google\" are both IT companies so hence they are related. \"London\" and \"England\" are related in that London is the capital of England. \"London\" and \"Paris\" might be related in that they are both major metropolitan cities (this one might be far fetched?).

Is IBM more similar to JPMorgan (both companies and located in New York), or to Microsoft (also both companies and in the same business area)? And in order to define this kind of similarity, we would need a DBpedia ontology, which we don't have yet. When we have this ontology, users could define that business area has a similarity weight of e.g. 0.7, whereas location only has 0.2. But again, that's hard at the moment without an ontology.

It is an identifier for the chemical compound displayed in the image. I think the image and the compound should be separated into two resources. The image resource could then be related to the compound resource using a property such as dbpedia:skeletalImage (or whatever the proper scientific term is). 2. Regarding the dc:identifier triples, I think this is a bit of an abuse of the dc:identifier property, because the value \"pubchemCID=961\" is not just an identifier, but a structured key/ value pair, where the key is the actual identifier. I think it would be more useful to do this: 961 This allows us to SPARQL directly for a certain identifier, without need to do further string processing. 3. A lot of interesting data is inside the CML block, which is an XML format but not RDF. Thus the data inside the CML cannot be SPARQLed or otherwise processed by RDF tools.

The idea is to use metadata \"within\" an image document, not separating the resources. This can already be done for digital images (Adobe XMP for example), but the metadata is not human-readable as well. But, moreover, I think it is useful to try to embed metadata in any resource (i.e HTML, SVG, png).

"Lua scripting on Wikipedia"	"uHi, I saw few days ago that MediaWiki since one month allow to create infoboxes (or part of them) with Lua scripting language.

My other question is mainly concerned by Wikipedia FR, because I don't found the same thing in english, sorry. Since almost one year for the infobox population property we can do something like that : population = {{population number}} Where \"population number\" refer to a number which is on another page. Let me give you an example, the Wikipedia page about Toulouse city, contain this infobox property : | population = {{DerniÃ¨re population commune de France}} And the value of \"DerniÃ¨re population commune de France\" is contained in this wikipedia page : So now the problem is that in the xml dump we don't have the real value of the population so it exist a way to have the value and not the \"string\" which represent the value ?

DBpedia does not parse template definitions, only content pages. The content pages probably will only change in minor ways, if at all. For example, {{Foo}} might change to {{#invoke:Foo}}. But that's just my preliminary understanding after looking through a few tuorial pages. I've seen similar structures on Wikipedia de [1] and I think also on pl or cs: the actual data is not in the content pages, but in some template, and is rendered on the content page by rather complex mechanisms. To deal with this, DBpedia could try to expand templates, or maybe just certain templates (we don't want all the HTML stuff). Great generality, but may cause perfomance and other problems. In the worst case, mapping-based extraction could become as slow as abstract extraction. Or we could let people add rules on the mappings wiki about which templates contain data and how the data should be attached to certain DBpedia resources. Of course, determining syntax and semantics for such rules wouldn't be trivial but if we get there, we could implement the data extraction as a preprocessing step: in a first extraction phase, go through the Wikipedia dump, collect and store stuff from these 'data templates', and during the main extraction, pull the data from the store where needed and generate triples. Informally, we already have such a preprocessing phase for the redirects. It would make sense to \"formalize\" it and also use it for other info, e.g. disambiguation pages, inter-language links, resource types, etc. Cheers, JC [1] For example, {{Infobox Gemeinde in Deutschland | Gemeindeschlüssel = 03241001 }} (\"Gemeinde in Deutschland\" means \"community in Germany\", \"Gemeindeschlüssel\" means \"community key\".)

Instead, we will end up either finding nothing (see InterWiki links) or finding wikidata parser functions, e.g. {{#property:p169}} as shown here [1] Maybe one approach could be to gather wikidata dumps and build some sort of triples stores, which can be used to resolve actual data during extraction (adding handling of specific parser functions in the extraction framework).

What we could do is (try to) provide a semantic mirror of Wikidata in i.e. data.dbpedia.org. We should simplify it by mapping the data to the DBpedia ontology and then use it like any other language edition we have (e.g. nl.dbpedia.org). In dbpedia.org we already aggregate data from other language editions. For now it is mostly labels & abstracts but we can also fuse Wikidata data.

"1st Challenge on Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD-1)"	"uThe challenge on Question Answering over Linked Data is on!. Please find below important information. We would be happy if you participate. [Apologies for cross-posting] 1st Challenge on Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD-1) collocated with the corresponding workshop at the Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC) * Motivation * While more and more semantic data is published on the Web, in particular following the Linked Data principles, the question of how typical Web users can access this body of knowledge through an intuitive and easy-to-use interface that hides the complexity of the Semantic Web standards becomes of crucial importance. Since users prefer to express their information need in natural language, one of the main challenges lies in translating the user's information needs into a form such that they can be automatically processed using standard Semantic Web query processing and inferencing techniques. In recent years, there have been important advances in semantic search and question answering over RDF data, and in parallel there has been substantial progress on question answering from textual data as well as in the area of natural language interfaces to databases. This shared task and the associated workshop aim at bringing together researchers from these communities that accept the challenge of scaling question answering approaches to the growing amount of heterogeneous and distributed Linked Data. Our long-term goal is to understand how we can develop QA approaches that deal with the fact that i) the amount of RDF data available on the Web is huge, ii) that this data is distributed and iii) that it is heterogeneous with respect to the vocabularies or schemas used. * Shared Task * Question answering systems of all kinds are invited to participate in the shared task of processing natural language queries and retrieving relevant answers from a given RDF dataset, thereby providing an in-depth view of the strength, capabilities and shortcomings of existing systems. Please note that although some of the questions are quite complex, nonetheless we would like to encourage everybody to participate in the challenge even if they can only successfully process a subset of the questions. Although the competition is tailored towards question answering systems based on natural language, we strongly encourage other relevant systems and methods that can benefit from the evaluation datasets to also report their results. * Datasets * We provide two datasets: DBpedia 3.6 and MusicBrainz. They can either be downloaded or accessed via a SPARQL endpoint. In addition, we provide 50 training questions for each dataset, annotated with corresponding SPARQL queries and answers. Later, during the test phase, participating systems will be evaluated with respect to precision and recall on a set of 50 similar questions. * Submission * Submission of results will be possible via an online form, available at the following site (from February 7th on). Submission of results on training data will be allowed at any time. Participants will receive the results on the training data for every submission. Submission of results on test data will be possible starting from April 1st and close on April 10th. Participants can submit as many runs as they want but will not receive any feedback. * Schedule * Release of QA training dataset and instructions: Feb 3 Release of QA testset: March 28 Submission of results by participants: April 1 Close of result submission on test data: April 10 * More information * For detailed information as well as links to the datasets and training questions, please check the workshop website: If you want to be regularly updated with information about the task, there is a QALD-1 mailing list, to which you can subscribe at the following location: All the best!"
"Quick Tweak to DBpedia Real-time Edition"	"uAll, When I read the notice from Sebastian earlier today, re. the new DBpedia & Wikipedia real-time variant, it dawned on me to use this new DBpedia instance to demonstrate a fundamental feature of DBpedia deployment. Basically, what I've referred to in prior commentary as a \"subtle nuance\" added to the Linked Data deployment mix. Sequence: 1. Our DBpedia partners at University of Leipzig put out an initial bet cut of DBpedia with real-time links to Wikipedia 2. Their demo links are to the SPARQL endpoint which produces a basic Web results page without any live links (de-referencable URIs) 3. I ping Sebastian and indicate to him that by simply installing the DBpedia VAD package (Virtuoso's equivalent of an RPM) you will get the same Linked Data deployment used by the live DBpedia instance, our EC2 AMIs, and the DBpedia on Virtuoso 6.0 instance that we are currently hot staging. Post the above (about 3 mins or less for me to install the VAD from Burlington, MA into the instance in Leipzig, Germany), we now have: 1. 2. An owl:sameAs link to 3. Local URI dereferencing on the Leipzig Virtuoso instance (irrespective of the actual URIs in the Quad Store, think of this as outbound rewrite rules to complement inbound rewrite rules via SPARQL). To conclude, this is a simple demonstration of how to address the problem of Linked Data Set propagation en route to Linked Data Web resilience i.e., a Linked Data Web where URIs may come and go, but the actual data (URI / Pointer referents) persist. The more replicas the more resilient the Linked Data Web becomes."
"Next DBpedia release ?"	"uHi, Just wondering if there was a schedule/roadmap for the next release(s) of the DBpedia dataset ? It's coming up to half a year since the last one was released and it would be nice to pull in some of the updated data from Wikipedia at some point. If there isn't going to be one soon, then does anyone have any stats on how long it takes to run the dbpedia extraction scripts (1-2 days) ? As I'd like to update my local copy of the data. Thanks, Rob uHi Rob, the issue was the availability of Wikipedia dumps. Dumps in April and Mai failed. A new working Wikipedia dump was released one week ago. The extraction is currently running on servers in Leipzig. @Jens/Sören: Do you have time to start a new extraction? Rob, the extraction should run approx. 2 days. And I would love to get some feedback if the extraction framework works for you :) Cheers, Georgi uUups, a little correction: uHello, robl schrieb: We'll probably start another extraction at the end of June. Christian Becker wants to update the GeoExtractor soon, the Yago mapping should be updated, and hopefully a few bugs will be fixed. Depends on your machine and on whether you've imported the Wikipedia dumps already. If everything runs smoothly, you need about 10 days on an average computer to import the dumps and extract the data sets. Of course, you can choose to extract only the data sets and language versions you need to reduce the runtime of the extraction script. Kind regards, Jens"

"Area code madness in DBPedia"	"uHi all, At the VU University Amsterdam, we're teaching various courses on the Semantic Web in which (understandably) DBPedia plays an important role. Over the past year's we have carefully groomed and curated a collection of example SPARQL queries against DBPedia. These queries revolve around cities with the \"020\" area code. To my surprise, these queries suddenly stopped working. Apparently because there has been a new release of DBPedia in which this was changed. howeverit turns out that they work sometimes but do not work at other timesmadness! ;-) A bit of background: The examples use the property (i.e. a curated property), and assume the area codes are represented as string literals, e.g. \"020\", sometimes with an erroneous language tag. It now seems that in some versions of the DBPedia endpoint, the property < data: there is no place name with a dbpedia-owl:areaCode property. Even though the areaCode property is still defined in the ontology (at least, that's what I see when I point my browser at it). In addition to that (and much much worse), in some versions of the DBPedia endpoint, area codes are represented as *integers*, but are syntactically still presented as the value they had as strings. E.g. the area code for Amsterdam is represented as 020 rather than \"020\". Needless to say that 020 as an integer is equal to 20hmthat's not what we want Area codes simply are not integers, they are strings, because the actual digits matter. (also, application developers should be able to rely on relative stability of statements that use the dbpedia ontology namespace, also, the ontology should only change monotonously: only add classes, properties etc., don't remove them!) In short: A couple of months ago, the area codes were represented as language tagged strings using the dbpedia-owl:areaCode property Yesterday morning at approx. 10 am, the area codes were represented as integers using the dbpedia-prop:areaCode property Yesterday evening, at approx. 10 pm, the area codes were represented as language tagged strings using the dbpedia-owl:areaCode property Today, at approx. 1 pm, the area codes were represented as integers using the dbpedia-prop:areaCode property It would be exceedingly nice if this could be fixed. Perhaps it has something to do with load balancing and different stores not being synchronized properly? -Rinke PS area codes may be stringsbut they don't have to be language-tagged ;-) Hi all, At the VU University Amsterdam, we&#39;re teaching various courses on the Semantic Web in which (understandably) DBPedia plays an important role.

I suggest we leave it for now. I really wasn't asking you to solve my problemit's trivial, I can come up with other equally relevant SPARQL examples if needed. I am well aware of the instability of the DBPedia property namespace, and only resorted to it because my normal route appeared to be blocked. I apologize if my initial email was overly polemic. I was just as surprised as you are that DBPedia behaved differently at different times: it shouldn't happen. As Kingsley says, the data is relatively stable. That's the reason I sent the email: just in case there was some weird bug on your end. I cannot provide proof other than what I told you. For now, a query on: ?city dbpedia-owl:areaCode \"020\"^^xsd:string seems to work, so I'm good to go. I'll keep a backup of the DBPedia-property namespace-based solution just in case the temporal flux appears again.

Some examples * it is \"reasonable\" for people to write \"8\"^^xsd:byte, and otherwise use many different data types when they want to express an integer. * say you are aggregating data into a vocabulary like foaf, once again there are multiple ways that people will encode email addresses no matter what you tell them, for instance as a literal string is reasonable, but also a mailto: URI is reasoanble.

"Shock Troopers of the Edit Wars?"

Anyway, this strikes me as wrong, but I can imagine that something like this might happen if there was a page called 'SS' that got renamed, and then somebody created a new one, and then that got renamed, and so forth. Right now if I look at dbpedia, I see in Wikipedia, however, this redirects to looking closely at the dbpedia page for \"SS\", I think there's some confusion with this rather nicer fellow: Anyway, I can believe that this has got something to do with the root cause of the general degradation of key integrity that I've seen in dbpedia 3.5."

What is the reason for the very slow result access when I start to query dbpedia? Do you have any suggestions on how to make this perform better?

The is a Unicode string (!= UTF-8 String), which can be turned into a valid \"URI character sequence\" by following the steps described above. In order to dereference such an IRI we need to transform it into its URI equivalent and then use HTTP. In other words: From the IRI rfc sec. 1.2.a: > \"On the other hand, in the HTTP protocol [RFC2616], the Request URI is defined as a URI, which means that direct use of IRIs is not allowed in HTTP requests.\" This means that while it is allowed to identify things in RDF with IRIs it isn't possible to look them up without prior encoding as %-escaped UTF-8 string, which then is a (ASCII) URI. Now, you might remember that you can just copy the into your browser and get results. Correct, but that's because most browsers do the IRI -> URI magic under the hood so you don't see that they actually request Cheers, JÃ¶rn"

"Looking for churches in Paris - skos:broader transitivity and dbpedia categories"	"uHi all I wanted to get at the following data set through \"Churches in Paris, along with French name and description, and geo-tagging elements\" The category \"Churches in Paris\" has typically two levels of subcategories, by \"Religion\", then by \"Arrondissement\" So the following query PREFIX p: PREFIX dbpedia: PREFIX category: PREFIX rdfs: PREFIX skos: PREFIX geo: SELECT DISTINCT ?m ?n ?p ?d WHERE { ?m rdfs:label ?n. ?m skos:subject ?c. ?c skos:broader category:Churches_in_Paris. ?m p:abstract ?d. ?m geo:point ?p FILTER ( lang(?n) = \"fr\" ) FILTER ( lang(?d) = \"fr\" )} yields only the two results which are in a direct subcategory. Which means skos:broader transitivity is not supported. OK. This leads to several remarks and questions. SKOS version declared in the namespace is the 2004 version, which is now superseded by the new 2008 SKOS specification and namespace. For those not aware of the long debate history in SKOS about broader transitivity, the sum up is as following skos(2004):broader is transitive skos(2008):broader is no more transitive. It links only to the direct parent. skos(2008):broaderTransitive is a superproperty of the above, and it is transitive - like skos(2004):broader To sum it up, the current dbpedia interface declares skos:broader in the 2004 namespace, but de facto applies the 2008 semantics (no transitivity). This is indeed confusing, and given there has been already a lot of confusion in people minds about that affair, it's too bad. Has dbpedia in project to switch from SKOS 2004 to SKOS 2008 namespace and semantics, and if yes when? And in such a case case, will it support skos2008:broaderTransitive queries? As a side note, skos:subject is deprecated in SKOS 2008. Back to my churches in Paris, is there currently a workaround to get the results for all subcategories in a single query? Thanks for your attention. uBernard, I don't know about plans regarding the namespace. Just one thing: Wikipedia categories are not transitive, and applying transitivity inference would produce undesirable results. This is because the category system is simply not a well-designed hierarchy, but rather a tagging system where categories can be tagged as well. For example, if we applied transitive inference, then category:Berlin would become a subcategory of category:Mexico, category:Asia, and category:Jesus. Don't ask why;-) Best, Richard On 21 Oct 2008, at 12:27, Bernard Vatant wrote: uRichard Cyganiak a écrit : Suppose so.

"Relationship between a category (skos:Concept) and the matching resource"	"uHello, I am planning to train topic models to recognize text content and find the most related skos:Concept from DBpedia. However most of the time the dbpedia nodes for categories / skos:Concept are less informative than the resource assiocated with the main article of the afore mentionned category in wikipedia. Let's take an example, the category \"History\" is available as a skos:Concept in dbpedia as: - It matches the following category page in wikipedia: - On that page you can see the text: The main article for this category is History. Which is a link to the following wikipedia page: - Which has the following RDF resource in DBpedia: - However the relationship: is not directly available in the DBpedia graph. So my questions are: 1- Is it safe to assume that for any in the matching 2- Is there a plan to make that relationship more explicit? Regards, uHi all, One year later I am hitting this issue again (see quoted email below for reference). Since last time it is now possible to improve the mappings using category information is extracted from there. Maybe the SKOS mapping logic is hardcoded in the extractor? To recap, the piece of data I am looking for is the link between a SKOS topic such as DBpedia resource that is matching the primary Wikipedia article of the category, in that case The Wikipedia makes this information explicitly available by the use of the template \"Cat_main\". For instance, the source of http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Arts includes the following snippet (generally at the beginning): {{Cat main|The arts}} It seems to be widely used for any category that has a real world semantic interpretation (not just for the sake of Wikipedia housekeeping): So my question is: is it possible to write a mapping for this using which target property should I map the relation too?

The choice of relation name is completely up to the mapper. At the moment, it is not possible to extract an object property for this, because \"The arts\" does not have a wiki link to its page, i.e. the \"[[\" and \"]]\" are missing. You can, however, write a mapping for the template Cat_main that extracts a string that contains this PropertyMapping: {{ PropertyMapping | templateProperty = 1 | ontologyProperty = wikiCategoryMainResource }} The result would be suboptimal: \"The Arts\" In order to be able to extract the better triple (as an object property) http://dbpedia.org/ontology/wikiCategoryMainResource http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Arts you would have to extend the mapping language. A flag that tells the extraction to always treat everything like a URI suffix would work. Or the more general solution, suggested by Pablo, to include something like a URI pattern that lets you specify a URI with a place holder in which found string is inserted. Links to external datasets could also benefit from this solution. Of course, you can also write separate extractor for this. Cheers, Max uThanks for your answers. A URI template mapper would indeed be useful IMHO. Maybe it should take URL escaping into account (at least the Wikipedia URL rules such as the special handling of whitespace chars that are replaced by underscore chars)."

The second one, partly covered by an NDA so I cannot be more precise, is an ambitious project that we will present to the next SemWeb09 called 99ways[3] where we are planning to make an intensive use of DBpedia. For example, we are currently making an autocompletion service that taking as input a substring it returns a list of DBpedia URIs grouped by their most representative skos:subject.

(If anyone's interested: a quick slideshow from a talk [1] and a longer post [2]. Code is all still sketchy, but here's [3] the data input form I'm working on, and an example [4] of using topics to find courses) So I'm using DBpedia to disambiguate concepts in the app, making heavy use of the lookup service (it's fantastic, BTW!), as well as to bring additional data into the app. On how I'd like to use it/seeing it evolve, I'm not sure if this goes against any of the design principles you are working from, but mechanisms and/or guidance to smooth out some of the oddities of the data in wikipedia would be wonderful. Take for example the sculpture The kinds of quirks I'm seeing are on the year property, c. 130 CE. In the wikipedia page, both 130 and CE have been made links to wikipedia entries. So DBpedia lists two dbp:years as resources for 130 and CE And often enough a dbp:year property comes through more as I'd expect it, as a literal. Similar examples of hard-to-predict data due to different individual linking choices in wikipedia are pretty common. And most can be worked through on my end, for example by looking for a lang attribute. But the overall evolution that I think would make it easier on the usage end is more predictability in the data coming back uAt Turn2Live.com we will start (soon) to consume music data about artists from LOD and obviously from DBpedia. We are at a very initial phase. Hope to have demos soon!

First of all, I'd like to congratulate the DBpedia community on doing such wonderful work on maintaining such an informative infrastructure.

I looked through the wiki on ways of getting involved and stumbled upon the fact that it is not complete in all aspects. There are outdated information, broken links and inconsistent information between the wiki hosted at Github and the official DBpedia wiki(though it complements each other). So, I thought what better way to contribute than to improve the documentation on 'How to contribute and get involved'. I wanted to make changes in the wiki but did not find enough information on how to create an account. So, I'd be glad if someone could give me some pointers to go ahead with creating an account and making changes. Thanks a lot again for the information and looking forward to being a part of the wonderful community.

Thanks, :Michael uHi Michael, we currently do not extract Gene Ontology data from Wikipedia. We extract data for which doesn't use Gene Ontology. The template (and maybe others?) uses Gene Ontology, but we don't have a mapping from that template to our ontology (yet). Besides, most (if not all) of the IDs we already extract (ISBN, Protein Data Bank ID, etc.) are defined as strings, not as numbers, because with most of these, ranges and other numeric operations don't make sense. Would it actually make sense to search for genes annotated with a GO category \"between\" GO:0005488 and GO:0008047? Not sure what you mean by \"descending from\" and \"2 hops from GO:0005488\", but I guess the DBpedia extraction and/or the browser would have to use some kind of inference to enable such searches. There are other domains in which such inference would be useful (e.g., the browser doesn't know that someone who was born in Berlin was also born in Europe), so maybe one day we will implement it, but it's currently not high on our to-do list.

I think I could have been clearer about my questions, but I was not sure of the context, and I'm not an expert in this area, so here are my \"speculations\": I think the issue is pretty general, in that it applies to ontologies other than GObecausealmost all ontologies define categories that are linked together in a hierarchical (or DAG) structure. So think of the (an) evolutionary \"tree\". The components (nodes) are linked (by edges) into a tree structure. (a subset of a graph) The names of each component either don't have type, or we don't care what the type is because they are just names, and the type conveys no \"relationship\" (as with the implicit relationships among integers). But just as you suggested with regard to cities, the relationships among the nodes may sometimes be useful for \"inference\", and \"mechanically,\" all that means is navigating an ontology as part of the search process. Suppose for example that you have a database of organisms that includes a genus-species for each organism, AND you have the (an) evolutionary tree at hand built from all organism categories from \"root\" to \"genus-species\". Then you can use the tree to help answer questions like \"Show me all the mammals\", because you can traverse the ontological tree \"down\" from mammal to the lowest level (\"genus-species\"?), and then list ANY organism from the database annotated with ANY category in the ontology \"below\" mammal. Now in the case of GO, things are a little different, but the ideas are similar. I might for example want a list of genes that have been annotated as being involved in any \"biological process\" that is a \"part_of\" (as indicated using the \"part_of\" predicate) a specific process. That is, I want to find any gene annotated as being part of any process that is one hop \"below\" the specific/target process. With respect to the \"is_a\" relationship within the \"molecular function\" portion of GO, I might want to ask for genes annotated as being types of \"enzyme activator activity\" (GO:0008047), so I might like to find genes annotated with GO:0008047 AND any category \"one hop below\" 8047 to find genes that are known to display more specific biochemical enzyme activity like \"helicase activity\" (GO:0004388) and \"ATPase activity\" (GO:0016887). (I'm using a mutated version of GO for this example, by the way; these relationships are not necessarily accurate.) This seems a bit too mechanical to call \"inference\", but as far as I can tell, that's exactly what happens \"under the covers\" if you apply inference rules along with an ontology to a database. Actually, this seems to me to be quite a powerful capability that may help distinguish semantic from relational approaches. It's not that you can't do things like this with relational databases, but I think it's \"harder\". For example, you can easily write a SparQL query to list all the n-level descendents or ancestors of a node in a tree, if you know \"n\". And then you can write another SparQL query to search for all nodes annotated with any member in the list. If you want to find ALL \"descendents\" you actually need to iterate an indeterminate number of times, which SparQL does not support so you have to enter multiple SparQL commands, arrange for inference rules to be applied, or build and navigate a transitive closure on the DAG, as far as I know. Well, regardless of this discussion I like your interface a LOTI think it REALLY simplifies the query process. When I present semantic technologies to normal people, they don't seem too excited about writing SparQL queries (well, ok, they recoil in horror :-), and your interface will provide another, much easier and more palatable, alternative. sothanks again for your work, and I hope you eventually find time to enhance it to support at least the basic \"hierarchy-relative\" queries, :michael grobe uDavid, Richard Not a big mystery if you have a look at the code source of the html page In your example the selected facet Person retrieves only a top list of instances which are cached in the page as an array var values = new Array(\"David (24)\",\"John (19)\" etc And the auto-suggest field taps in this array using javascript new AutoSuggest(\"foaf-name\", values); So it does not query the data base Not really a bug, not really a clean feature either :) Bernard 2009/9/28 Richard Cyganiak < >"

Thank you for your answers. Gratis per te Avatar per Messenger e sfondi per il PC landing2.aspx?culture=it-it ucassio steel wrote: Well, there's one question here: \"do you want the right answers?\" I suppose that somebody could extract RDF statements out of freebase, load them into the same graph as dbpedia, and then use the published dbpedia <-> freebase owl:sameAs statements to map them together. If you did that, AND IF YOU CHECKED THE VALIDITY OF YOUR ANSWERS (which is NOT standard practice in semweb research, so far as I can tell) you'd note that the mappings are horribly wrong. The dbpedia <-> freebase mappings are so bad that they'll substantially change the semantics of dbpedia, even if you never load anything from Freebase; for instance, you can easily infer bizzare and incorrect statements such as dbpedia:Area_11 owl:sameAs dbpedia:Japan. it just isn't so, and results in the inference of millions of extra bogus triples, for instance, dbpedia:Japan rdfs:Label \"Area 11\"@en . I found this out when I was trying to establish a 1-1 relationship between some set of entities and iso codes for countries and second-level administrative division (needed that because 90% of the \"Countries\" in the dbpedia ontology are fictional or not going concerns, i.e. \"Austria-Hungary\", \"The Republic Of Atlantis\", etc.) The ISO codes are in freebase, but the dbpedia <-> freebase mappings were so bad that I decided to give up on Dbpedia as a \"primary reference\", use Freebase and just cherry pick selected information items out of it. To be fair, I do have freebase <-> dbpedia mappings that are much better quality than the ones on the dbpedia site and the time might be right to publish them. The issue here is that there are two ways you can construct said mapping: (i) when fb items are created from wikipedia extraction, the wikipedia page id is recorded in freebase; these can be looked up against the \"page Id\" file from dbpedia. (ii) freebase contains a set of \"keys\" that name items in freebase; some of these keys are in the wikipedia namespace, and those can be mapped to dbpedia pretty easily. The published mappings look a lot like (ii); the keys are really promiscuous and link up things that are at most circumstantially related uCassio, The short answer to your question (as I understood it) is that you could not issue such a query to the dbpedia sparql endpoint by itself. Somehow you would need to get access to an endpoint that contains both the freebase data as RDF and the mappings that Paul discusses here in order to run your query.

Sorry for the inconvenience, I should have added a comment (hmm, to the not yet existing documentation) Cheers, Georgi"

"Fake Conferences CSCI and WORLDCOMP of Hamid Arabnia"	"uFake Conferences CSCI and WORLDCOMP of Hamid Arabnia Hamid Arabnia from University of Georgia is well known for his fake WORLDCOMP conferences deceive researchers anymore using his WORLDCOMP. Hamid Arabnia (Guru of Fake Conferences and champion of academic scam) has recently started 2014 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI'14) researchers further. CSCI'14 is started under the title of âAmerican Council on Science and Educationâ which is a dummy corporation (does not exist anywhere in the world). Hamid Arabnia buried his name in the list of names of other innocent steering and program committee members of CSCIâ14 to avoid any special attention. He knows that if his name is given any special attention then researchers immediately know that the conference is fake due to his âtrack recordâ with WORLDCOMP. Hamid Arabnia (the money hungry beast) spoiled the reputations and careers of many authors and committee members involved in his infamous WORLDCOMP for more than a decade and he is now ready to do the same using CSCI. Interestingly, CSCI is scheduled to be held at the same venue where WORLDCOMP was held until 2012. Hamid Arabnia claimed that CSCI proceedings will be published by IEEE but no one knows if IEEE really publishes. Many scholars have already sent emails to IEEE protesting for the unethical behavior of Hamid Arabnia and for the new series of his bogus conferences CSCI. CSCI paper submission deadline will be extended multiple times as usual. Do not spoil your resume by submitting your papers in this bogus conference CSCI which will not be held beyond 2014.

I ask that question because the Arabic mapping of DBpedia still very little, so are that mappings the only available knowledge in that language in DBpedia? If someone needs to get information from English Wikipedia in an Arabic interface, is that available? If I have an entities and relationships that are represented in Arabic, how can I relate them to the corresponding entities and predicates or properties in DBpedia?

However, this is far from the case for me, and I have been rather stumped in trying to resolve things. As a slight side point, I should note that I did have to make a few minor modifications to my environment after the clean installation of PHP. I was receiving message boxes complaining that the modules libglib-2.0-0.dll and OCI.dll could not be found, but this was resolved by copying the bin dir of the GTK+ bundle for Windows into the root PHP dir (for the former DLL) and commenting out the following lines in php.ini (for the latter DLL): ;[PHP_OCI8] ;extension=php_oci8.dll ;[PHP_OCI8_11G] ;extension=php_oci8_11g.dll ;[PHP_PDO_OCI] ;extension=php_pdo_oci.dll However, judging by the presumed resolution of these issues and the details of the error messages I am no receiving, this likely has nothing to do with my current issues.

Thanks for the speedy fix. However, running extract_test.php does not seem to actually be outputting the RDF triples. The following is what I get running the script from command prompt. C:\Users\Alex\Documents\DBpedia\extraction>php extract_test.php \"London\"@en . The output takes about two seconds to appear, followed by the program immediately terminating. As I understand, extract_test.php should be using SimpleDumpDestination and thus printing directly to stdout. Any ideas please? Regards, Alex uHello, Alex schrieb: Doesn't it print to stdout? Reading your message, it appears that one triple (in N-Triples format) was extracted and print to stdout. extract_test.php downloads the page specified in extract.php from Wikipedia (which explains the delay). In this case, it is the article about \"London\". It then runs the extractor specified in extract_test.php on this article (by default \"SampleExtractor\"). The result is printed to stdout. As mentioned previously, extract_full.php should be used for producing a complete DBpedia release (but you need to use import.php to download the corresponding Wikipedia dumps before and import them in MySQL databases). Kind regards, Jens uHi, That was just me being silly, it seems. I failed to notice that extract_test.php uses SampleExtractor, and that SamplExtractor is only meant to print out one triple. Changing it to use InfoboxExtractor proves that the framework is indeed working. There is one other point to note, howeverThe databaseconfig.php file is now missing from the SVN repository.

"A modeling issue?"	"uHi, I was trying to create a query to retrieve nuclear power plants from dbpedia. My query was like this. SELECT * where { ?concept skos:broader . ?subject skos:broader ?concept. ?plant skos:subject ?subject. ?plant a ?type. ?type rdfs:subClassOf yago-class:Station104306080. } I did another query for airports where I was able to use rdf:type of . I thought I would be able to use rdfs:type for my query of nuclear power stations, but nuclear power stations didn't seem to use that concept - not sure why. From the results of my query I quickly noticed that San Onofre Nuclear power plant, among others was not in the results. I looked up San Onofre at this address It is categorized as a dbpedia:Category:Domes nd dbpedia:Category:Energy_resource_facilities_in_California . since dbpedia:Category:Nuclear_power_stations skos:broader dbpedia:Category:Domes I thought maybe the connection there would let me get San Onofre, but it seems it would include a lot of other Domes that are not dbpedia:Category:Nuclear_power_stations . However I also saw this Nuclear Power station (that didn't come up in my results) dbpedia:Rancho_Seco_Nuclear_Generating_Station which is not a dome, so that doesn't really help. Bottom line after I got my query for airports together I thought it wouldn't be a big deal to find other things categorically. I get the feeling from working this example that is not the case. Can you see a better way to get the nuclear power stations? Is this problem due to the way dbpedia information is modeled? Do you think this data will get better? Thanks Brian uHi Brian, two reasons you can't find your powerplant in DBpedia in the same way you found airports: 1. has no infobox. Compare e.g. to the wiki markup by clicking on \"edit this page\". There you see the \"infobox NPP\". We need those infoboxes to extract the main structured data for a resource and to assign a class in the dbpedia ontology. 2. We don't have nuclear power plants in the dbpedia ontology yet. As I wrote in my email to the mailinglist an hour ago, the ontology and the mappings were defined manually, and we just started with the classes/infoboxes that seems most relevant to us, since that's a lot of work. So even the Limerick Nuclear Power Plant won't show up in the ontology dataset at the moment. And we don't have a user interface for the community to help with the mappings yet. If you want to help, you can \"design\" the power plant class and all according properties for the dbpedia ontology (see infoboxes to ontology properties. I will include them in our mapping-repository and extract your data.

Thank you ! Olivier Sollier uHi Olivier, On 09/06/2012 07:32 PM, Sollier Olivier wrote: The abstract extractor requires the installation of a local mirror of Wikipedia, at least for the required language, in order for it to be able to resolve templates. A template is a simple sequence of characters that has a special meaning for Wikipedia, and those templates are handled in special way. Ex: {{convert|1010000|km2|sp=us}} This templates tells Wikipedia that the area of some country is 1010000 square kilometers, and when it is rendered, Wikipedia should display its area in both square kilometers, and square miles. So, Wikipedia will render it as â1,010,000 square kilometers (390,000 sq mi)â. So, the abstract extractor cannot work correctly without this local Wikipedia.

"GSoC 2013 DBpedia + Spotlight joint proposal (please contribute within the next days)"	"uDear lists, Dimitris Kontokostas has started to draft a document for submission at Google Summer of Code: We are still in need of ideas and mentors. If you have any improvements on DBpedia or DBpedia Spotlight that you would like to have done, please submit it in the ideas section now. Note that accepted GSoC students will receive about 5000 USD, which can help you to estimate the effort and size of proposed ideas. It is also ok to extend/amend exisiting ideas (as long as you don't hi-jack them) Becoming a mentor is also a very good way to get involved with DBpedia. As a mentor you will also be able to vote on proposals, after Google accepts our project. Note that it is also ok, if you are a researcher and have a suitable student to submit an idea and become mentor. After acceptance by Google the student then has to apply for the idea and get accepted. Please take some time this week to add your ideas and apply as a mentor, if applicable. Feel free to improve the introduction as well and comment on the rest of the document. Information on GSoC in general can be found here: Thank you for your help, Sebastian uDear all, Today evening we will move the Google Document to the wiki. This is is a kind reminder to add any contributions before that for easier collaboration.

Money is not a good gauge of the scope of the projects - $5000 is worth a lot less in Ireland than it is in Germany, a lot less in Germany than in Russia, etc. The two things to bear in mind are that 1) this competition is open to _all_ students registered to a third level institution - from first year to PhD; and 2) the projects are intended to take 3 months, with 1 month of 'community bonding', where the student should take care of any background research that may be needed for the project. The ideas don't need to be fully formed - though if there are details, it's nice to provide them - they just need to beideas. There is almost a month between the publication of the list of organisations and the deadline for proposals, which can be used to refine the ideas - at Apertium, we have students discussing ideas with us *now*, even though there is no guarantee that we will be accepted. Also, the project ideas are intended to be a guide: the students are free to - and should be encouraged to! - submit their own ideas. They may additionally - if they can't find a suitable organisation - apply to the Google Open Source Office, provided that they can suggest a suitable mentor, though this is typically an option only available for more research-oriented projects. uHi Jimmy, thanks for your tips! I added/extended two ideas yesterday. I ended up at six to eight paragraphs with 400 to 500 words. Do you think that's too long? The 2012 ideas I looked at were shorter.

Instead of using the mappings wiki, with GSoC money, in 3 months, we could probably do something better. More like the mapping tool, or like WikiData itself does. I don't see why we need that ridiculous wiki syntax to be any more in the middle of our lives. A simple database-backed application would do it. All we need is to associate identifiers from once source to identifiers of another source. There was a nice thread at the WikiData list from which we could extract a couple of nice things for our GSoC2013 proposal: 1) BBC is effectively using DBpedia to solve very real world problems. This should be in our intro. 2) - Our identification mechanism needs work - Our simplistic typing heuristics via Infobox needs work These two things could be *part* of GSoC 2013 projects.

See e.g. [1] for an approach of deriving \"ontology patterns\" from data, in order to optimize the semantics of the ontology. In DBpedia, one may want to establish one or more thresholds (even contextual or dynamic) for including alternative types in the domain/range of properties. Vishal's example spots the optimism of mapping dbpprop:allegiance directly to dbpedia-owl:country, while dbpprop:allegiance can range on the following types: i.e. about 855 out of 9660 (almost 9%) are not places (let alone countries, which are 8336, i.e. 86%). That would make a 14% error rate on the declared range, quite a lot.

Although DBpedia Spotlight shares a family name with the DBpedia Extraction Framework and the DBpedia Dataset, we are a separate project (which benefits from the clever work done by the rest of the DBpedia family). The message might be marginally interesting to the people in here, but I think it's more appropriate to move it to the dbp-spotlight-users mailing list (CCed in this message). Please redirect the rest of this thread there. Yes, you can use your own ontology in two ways. First, you can use it to select which kinds of *DBpedia resources* to include in the annotations. For that you only need to have mappings from your ontology to DBpedia and load all the data into a SPARQL endpoint that will then be used when giving a SPARQL query to DBpedia Spotlight. Second, you can teach DBpedia Spotlight to recognize instances of your own ontology (instead of only DBpedia Resources). At the moment you would also require a corpus containing annotations of instances of such ontology, or mappings to DBpedia (for which we have Wikipedia as a corpus). We need these text examples in order to \"teach\" DBpedia Spotlight to recognize your entities once a new text is presented to the system. More help is available here: Does this answer your question?

But actually the SPARQL protocol is fairly simple. If you have a SPARQL query and a SPARQL endpoint, then it's very easy to construct the query URL and send an HTTP request and get back a SPARQL result in XML. The SPARQL XML result format is quite simple as well, so you can parse it with any off-the-shelf XML parser. Or use the JSON result format and process it with an off-the-shelf JSON tool.

"wikipedia articles using intermediary template"	"uHi all! I'm trying to use dbpedia to collect weather statistics for cities. Most of those use the Weather box wikipedia template and its parameters (the stats I need) are then mapped directly into the corresponding dbpedia page.

For those cities (or so it seems), the weather stats don't end up in the corresponding dbpedia page (as is the case for Seattle ). So here are my questions : 1.

Background DBpedia and Wikidata currently focus primarily on representing factual knowledge as contained in Wikipedia infoboxes. A vast amount of information, however, is contained in the unstructured Wikipedia article texts. With the DBpedia Open Text Extraction Challenge, we aim to spur knowledge extraction from Wikipedia article texts in order to dramatically broaden and deepen the amount of structured DBpedia/Wikipedia data and provide a platform for benchmarking various extraction tools. Mission Wikipedia has become the ubiquitous source of knowledge for the world enabling humans to lookup definitions, quickly become familiar with new topics, read up background infos for news event and many more - even settling coffee house arguments via a quick mobile research.

The DBpedia Association and the people behind this challenge are committed to provide the necessary infrastructure and drive the challenge for an indefinite time as well as potentially extend the challenge beyond Wikipedia. We provide the extracted and cleaned full text for all Wikipedia articles from 9 different languages in regular intervals for download and as Docker in the machine readable NIF-RDF format (Example for Barrack Obama in English ).

However, it would be useful to initiate a parallel challenge/effort to represent a limited portion of the current Wikipedia article text as semantic representation, eliminating the text altogether. In this approach, the Wikipedia information would be semantically encoded as its original representation, as opposed to using text to represent the information. A small subset of Wikipedia subject matter could be used for this experiment. After the limited Wikipedia domain of interest was fully semantically represented, tools could be developed to translate the semantic representation into human readable text. It seems over the long run creating the original knowledge as a semantic representation, instead of text, would result in a Wikipedia knowledge base that upon query by humans could automatically perform the necessary translation into text in whichever human language the user desired. This concept would also facilitate machine to machine use of the Wikipedia knowledge base, which is currently difficult, if not impossible, due to the textual nature of the information. You could also envision tools that would eventually make it easy for authors to source the article information directly in semantic representation. The end results would be a DBpedia on steroids and the eventually elimination of Wikipedia as the original article text sources would no longer be needed.

We also acknowledge the initial engineering effort and will be lenient on technical requirements for the first submissions and will focus evaluation on the extracted triples and allow late submissions, if they are coordinated with us. Background DBpedia and Wikidata currently focus primarily on representing factual knowledge as contained in Wikipedia infoboxes. A vast amount of information, however, is contained in the unstructured Wikipedia article texts. With the DBpedia Open Text Extraction Challenge, we aim to spur knowledge extraction from Wikipedia article texts in order to dramatically broaden and deepen the amount of structured DBpedia/Wikipedia data and provide a platform for benchmarking various extraction tools. Mission Wikipedia has become the ubiquitous source of knowledge for the world enabling humans to lookup definitions, quickly become familiar with new topics, read up background infos for news event and many more - even settling coffee house arguments via a quick mobile research. The mission of DBpedia in general is to harvest Wikipediaâs knowledge, refine and structure it and then disseminate it on the web - in a free and open manner - for IT users and businesses.

Like you could replace part of the text with Wikidata information, which goes in the direction of your proposal. However, although the feature exists, I was unable to find any example of this in the article text, but I only looked briefly. Maybe somebody else? Not sure, whether you can tell whole articles, stories or essays in a semantic language. A lot of information would be lost, if you do it in OWL. Also it seems very hard to encode it even using something like Attempto Controlled English: Our motivation is that we do try getting more information with relation extraction for now until something better presents itself. all the best, Sebastian On 07.03.2017 15:31, Paul Houle wrote:"

"License of dbpedia content"	"uHoi, I have had a look at dbpedia and I like it a lot. What I am wondering about is the motivation for the license. Is the license chosen because Wikipedia is available under the GFDL and consequently keeping this data under the GFDL prevents any potential issues? If so many in the Wikimedia Foundation that the choice for the GFDL is only because there were no real alternatives for it at the time when Wikipedia was started. In my opinion, by performing data-mining on Wikipedia you create a new work and consequently it does not need to be provided under the GFDL. Also when someone else takes the routines that are part of what dbpedia is, it will be his option to choose a licence. For me this is a very practical question, the project I work on, OmegaWiki, provides its data that is in the \"community dataset\" under a combined GFDL/CC-by license. The rationale for this is that we want people to know where to go when they use our data for updates or for amending our data. We allow for other datasets and these do not have to be under either license. The only thing we insist on is that changes will to these datasets occur in our community dataset and will be under the GFDL/C-by license. When you also consider that you cannot copyright facts, it is clear that there is relatively little merit in copyrighting in the first place. What you can copyright is a collection of facts but by doing so, dbpedia would make itself as a resource less valid and valuable.

Because of its GFDL license you may be able to get permission to link other resources into dbpedia. When work is done on the data that leads to what amount to improvements for the other party, it can not take these improvements and incorporate them into its resource because of the viral aspects of the GFDL license. A case in point, in the database of the OmegaWiki environment, we allow for multiple datasets. Two of these datasets are of scientific importance. When our community dataset is only available under the GFDL, new information in our community dataset that may be of interest to the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics or the National Library of Medicine. This would be utterly unacceptable and we would not be able to collaborate with them. There are however two distinct issues that I raised; - I asked you to consider the license of dbpedia itself - The license of the result of a run of the dbpedia software itself is not necessarily under the GFDL Potential cooperation will not be as strong and vibrant when people are forced to run the dbpedia software themselves and pick what is of interest to them without giving back. Most valuable is the cooperation and the extension of data that becomes available by connecting resources.

I don't see how the GFDL impairs your ability to use DBpedia URIs in your work. The aim here is to virally propagate Open Linked Data in line the an overarching Open Data vision for the Web. If you were to import DBpedia data into a local system etc. And then produce a variant of the data set without derferencable URIs or work with customers that seek such a solution, then I believe this is contrary to the aims of DBpedia. If you look at Wikipedia derivatives, the data is never locked. The key here is to never morph the data into a format that is locked. That said, I am replying based on the spirit of the project rather than having combed through th GFDL :-) As I recall responding in the past about the spirit of iODBC in relation to GPL only to find the GPL incongruent with what I espoused which lead to a serious flame war between Richard Stallman and I, which ultimately lead to a data access regression in the SQL realm as demonstrated by: 1. iODBC and unixODBC being two projects that offer the same thing with little value on the constructive competition front 2. A LAMP Stack that is DBMS specific (*negative implications are still working their way through to the surface across the user and developer realms*) Kingsley uWhat damage?? You're free to take free data if you like. The GFDL does not prevent you to do anything, it only creates new possibilities. If you don't like the GNU FDL (or any license), then build a resource like that yourself (but that's likely not as cheap as using the GFDL-ed data).

I hope that we can discuss the issues surrounding DBpedia licensing without knee-jerk pro- or anti- GFDL zealotry. A much more interesting question is wether the DBpedia datasets constitute new works that can be licensed any way we want, or wether they are derivative works and therefore *must* be GFDL-licensed to comply with the Wikipedia license.

It's like: you can come to my party, IF you behave nicely. I don't think that really restricts you. Very practical, actually. It just takes much time; effort put in by people who believe in the GFDL license. I think (I'm not a lawyer) that DBPedia *is* a derivate under Dutch law, as machines have been involved to derive information from the original information. My reasoning is: the information in DBPedia is 1:1 based on the WP content: if the WP content would make different triples, DBPedia would follow that. The fact that there is no (manual) interpretation involved, only strengthens my believe that DBPedia is really no new 'work'. There are also some rules for how much you may cite. DBPedia also cites much more statements from WP than any legal number would allow, making DBPedia really a derivative. Egon uHoi, I disagree with Egon. There is substantial effort invested in creating the routines that produce the data that is dbpedia. Also the data is substantially different from the information that is in Wikipedia. I have discussed issues like this with several people in the Wikimedia Foundation and their attitude is typically that they want people to do good with the WMF data. Also by suggesting that dbpedia is only something that is based on Wikipedia, you deny its potential. Where it says that GFDL allows things as long as it is in a compatible license, it is wrong, there are no compatible licenses to the GFDL. There is some work going on to make the GFDL compatible with other licenses but from what I understand this is not going anywhere fast. It is not even likely to get anywhere.

Does a derivative work stop being a derivative work if sufficient effort has been spent on it? How much effort? That's debatable. Every single RDF literal in DBpedia is lifted from some place in Wikipedia, by a conceptually fairly simple mechanical process. I have no doubt about that. And perhaps they have not chosen the best possible license for that goal. This doesn't change the fact that any re-use of Wikipedia content is subject to the GFDL. I don't think being based on Wikipedia takes away from DBpedia's potential. Here's another interesting data point: Freebase uses Wikipedia content. Their licensing page [1] states: Texts in Freebase are documents with potentially many authors. Texts may have one of two different licenses: [] GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL). Descriptions that are automatically summarized from Wikipedia articles are licensed under the GFDL, which requires re- publishers of the summary to credit Wikipedia. All Freebase topics that display material from Wikipedia articles provide explicit reference to the GFDL and the Wikipedia. But the Freebase folks don't seem to think that this infects the rest of their content and data, which is CC-by licensed.

"URIs vs. other IDs (Was: New user interface for dbpedia.org)"	"uHi Kingsley, We are getting a bit off-topic here, but let me answer briefly On 07.02.2015 21:36, Kingsley Idehen wrote: That's not my point (I know the difference, of course). Wikidata stores neither Wikipedia URLs nor DBpedia URIs. It just stores Wikipedia article names together with Wikimedia site (project) identifiers. The work to get from there to the URL is the same as the work to get to the URI. Storing either explicitly in another property value would only introduce redundancy (and potential inconsistencies). In a Linked Data export you could easily include one or both of these URIs, depending on the application, but it's not so clear that doing this in a data viewer would make much sense. Surely it would not be useful if people would have to enter all of this data manually three times. On that note, is it the current best practice that all linked data exports include links to all other datasets that contain related information (exhaustive two-way linking)? That seems like a lot of triples and not very feasible if the LOD Web grows (a bit like two-way HTML linking ;-). Wouldn't it be more practical to integrate via shared key values? In this case, Wikipedia URLs might be a sensible choice to indicate the topic of a resource, rather than requiring all resources that have a Wikipedia article as their topic to cross link to all (quadratically many) other such resources directly. I would be curious to hear your take on this. Sure, but you are confusing the purpose of URIs with the underlying technical standard here. People use identifiers to refer to entities, or course, yet they do not use identifiers that are based on the URI standard. We both know about the limitations of this approach, but that does not change the shape of the IDs people use to refer to things (e.g., on Freebase, but it is the same elsewhere). Usually, if you want to interface with such data collections (be it via UIs or via APIs), you need to use their official IDs, while URIs are not supported. This is also the answer to your other comment. You are only seeing the purpose of the identifier, and you rightly say that there should be no big technical issue to use a URI instead. I agree, yet it has to be done, and it has to be done differently for each case. There is no general rule how to construct URIs from the official IDs used by open data collections on today's Web. A related \"problem\" is that most online data sets have UIs that are much more user friendly than any LOD browser could be based on the RDF they export. There is no incentive for users to click on a LOD-based view of, say, IMDB, if they can just go to the IMDB page instead. This should be taken into account when building a DBpedia LOD view (back on topic! ;-): people who want to learn about something will usually be better served by going to Wikipedia; the target audience of the viewer is probably a different group who wants to inspect the DBpedia data set. This should probably affect how the UI is built, and maybe will lead to different design decisions than in the Wikidata browser I mentioned.

Yes, you have industry standard identifiers, ditto HTTP URI that identify things in regards to Linked Open Data principles. You simply use relations such as dcterms:identifier (and the like) to incorporate industry standard identifiers into an entity description. Even better, those relations should be inverse-functional in nature. That's really it. DBpedia Identifiers (HTTP URI based References) and Industry Standard Identifiers (typically literal in nature) aren't mutually exclusive. Getting back on topic, reasonator is a nice UI.

I'm aware that this may be difficult to achieve, but it could be worth some effort: For German, there are only 422,819 labels available in DBpedia for matching with other vocabs (versus 2,866,994 labels plus 3,117,024 redirects for English). The German Wikipedia has 864,699 pages and more than 609,000 redirects, so only a small part of the information available there can be used in DBpedia. Are there some ideas out there how foreign-language-only entries could be added to the DBpedia dataset? (and how we could get rid of foreign-language entries which are connected to the English version afterwards and therefore are sameAs the first class (English) DBpedia entries?) Cheers, Joachim uHello Joachim, I agree that there's a demand for URIs for foreign-language-only entries. One approach *could* be to create DBpedia namespaces for every language, such as languages with owl:sameAs links. So But this would mean minting a lot of new URIs, and I'm not completely convinced of that approach. But I don't really see another solution for the problem of URIs for foreign-language-only entries. We can't add the foreign entities to the main dbpedia namespace, because that would mess things up completely, and there certainly are a lot of articles with the same name but referring to different concepts across languages. Note that we can represent data extracted from infoboxes from other languages by using e.g. Named Graphs, so this is only about those entities which are *not* in the English Wikipedia as well. So I'd like to ask the community: 1) Do you like the above approach? 2) How deeply do you need URIs for non-english concepts (those which can't be added to the English Wikipedia) Cheers, Georgi uGeorgi Kobilarov wrote: Georgi, We have to mint new URIs, and there is nothing wrong with that; as along as each entity has an \"rdf:type\" that links into one or more reasonable taxonomies.

A single unified namespace would be better in theory, but I don't see any pragmatic possibility for managing such a namespace for DBpedia. Richard uThanks for the feedback so far! Seems like we should/will go for the approach of minting language-specific URIs for DBpedia resources and interlink them with owl:sameas. uThis would be a great means for using all these URIs. One thing I am not sure about, because I'm quite new in the Semantic Web: DBpedia is about things (persons, etc.). It would be an advantage to have one prefered URI for these things across all languages. Therefore, if a link between the English and the Italian wikipedia pages for an actor is established, and derived from this a DBpedia owl:sameAs, it would be nice to be able to express that the prefered URI is the one from dbpedia.org, not from it.dbpedia.org. This could also help if circles across languages should occur (eg. from redirects). I suppose that the problem is not specific to dbpedia, and maybe there are best practices in dealing with it I am not aware of. Cheers, Joachim"

"New Entity Descriptor Document Formats"	"uAll, You may have picked this up from my tweets earlier today. We can now produce Atom (using OData's Atom+Feed dialect) based Descriptor Documents for Entities in DBpedia, LOD Cloud Cache, and any other Virtuoso based RDF store. Implications: Ultimately (once we iron some issues with existing 3rd party OData clients), transparent OData application access and exposure for all Descriptor Docs of all the LOD Cloud Cache and DBpedia Entities. Naturally, we encourage other RDF store providers to emulate what we've done re. building a bridge to the burgeoning OData realm (publication and consumption). Business of Linked Data Note: Microsoft has a market place for OData sets in place called \"Dallas\". In a nutshell, they want to make the process of curating and maintaining data sets sustainable via a compensation system.

"Disambiguating nutritional facts infoboxes"	"uHi, I am looking at DBPedia for nutritional facts.

Take dbpedia:Squab_(food) as an example. The infobox on Wikipedia states \"There is some variation in nutritional content depending on the breed of utility pigeon used for squabbing.\". It is copied into DBPedia as a dbpprop:note, and I am not sure how to automatically figure out whether it relates to the infobox or not. Also I am missing the citation from Wikipedia. 2. Take dbpedia:Coconut as an example. The Wikipedia article has two infoboxes related to nutrition, one being \"Coconut-inner edible solid part, raw (fresh kopra)\", another \"coconut water\". In DBPedia all the values are collected, so every property have two values and I think it is almost impossible to figure out which value relates to which infobox. Furthermore the only place I see the name of the two infoboxes is the dbpprop:name, but it also contains two extra unrelated values. 3. Sometimes there is a source (e.g. USDA Nutrient Database). I can look at the property dbpprop:sourceUsda for an ID, but sometimes it just contains 1 if the infobox only links to the USDA search website in general and not the actual entry. Occasionally the value is just wrong, as in dbpedia:Orange_juice, where the USDA ID points to \"classic sirloin steak (10 oz)\". Maybe it is just because it was corrected on Wikipedia after the last import? 4. Sometimes there is a note saying \"Percentages are roughly approximated using US recommendations for adults\" including a link with further information. This information is not copied to DBPedia. How could this be improved. It might involve a lot of work, and I think the following points are important to consider: A. Create an ontology that corresponds to the combined ways of using the nutritional facts infobox. Create a resource for each infobox. B. Each nutritional facts resource must be named accordingly. It should contain notes if the values are uncertain in some way. It should reference sources if available.

Cheers, Bjarke Walling uHi Bjarke, I work a bit on Food & Drink (edamam.com before, now Europeana Food & Drink which is not about nutrition but anyway). For edamam we processed recipes. We targeted USDA Standard Reference (is this the same as USDA Nutrient Database?). - We mapped normal food names (e.g. Steak) to one of the hundreds of steaks on USDA using a FreeBase dataset - We mapped ingredient lines (especially unit and number) using heuristics and duct tape. Oh it was so much fun! I haven't looked at nutrition info on Wikipedia, but knowing how fiddly is this info, I doubt it'd be structured and entered properly in every article to enable good extraction. You make a good point with Coconut: why put two foods on one page? AFAIK, DBpedia can't extract twice from the same page. I think you're better off looking at specialized sites. 1. Mostly about nutritional values, labels, countries of ready foods. Has a great number of varieties and brands. Mostly EN & FR 2. - info - very well done, but only Russian, from - eg 3. - info - food: 66k recipes, 22k persons, classified foods (eg seafood, spices) - foodista: 32k recipes - uses this ontology, let me know if you find a RDF file Even if not, you can model something similar in DBpedia; or use hRecipe or schema.org/Recipe"

"DBpedia-Cyc linkage"	"uHi all, The commonsense knowledge base Cyc [1] or OpenCyc [2] (when compared to DBpedia) seems to follow a rather top-down approach  first more abstract concepts and entities are represented and later Cyc started to include also more domain knowledge. This seems to be reasonable, since domain knowledge changes faster and there is much more of it. On the other hand, domain knowledge is usually, what people need to solve real problems within their domains. DBpedia contains primarily domain knowledge, hence a combination of both  Cyc and DBpedia  could really be a winning team. Together with the committed OpenCyc community we produced a first DBpedia-Cyc linkage, which is now available as a DBpedia dataset from the downloads section [3]. The dataset will soon also be loaded into the DBpedia SPARQL endpoint and made available as linked data. More information about the linkage can be also found at: OpenCyc"

Long answer: It invokes a Virtuoso built-in-function (that's what the acronym BIF stands for - historical reasons.) Note that you can call Virtuoso's SQL functions and stored procedures from both WHERE and result patterns. We use the sql: and bif: namespaces for that. See Calling SQL from SPARQL for an explanation. Using the regex pattern. It uses Virtuoso's full text index, which is significantly faster if you have a large number of literals to search from. Please see I don't think we have a tutorial no regex specifically, though I'm not in that department. If you peruse the Virtuoso documentation, you should find at least some examples there.

"How to use mappingBasedExtractor without *.xls files?"	"uHello! I want to use dbpedia to parse Slovenian wiki. I fixed and updated most of the extractors, that they are more translation friendly and now I want to use mappingBasedExtractor. The problem is that mapping.xls and rules.xls which I wanted to use to create the ontology were deleted in revision 1441 with log message \"No longer needed\". I googled and found this topic I want to know if I should use mapping.xls and rules.xls from previous revision and create ontology with them or wait for this new way of specifying mappings and how long would that probably be? I also see that *.csv files in ontology folder were updated even after *.xls files were removed but mapping.xls from last usefull revision is the same as one I donwnloaded in june. Best regards, Marko uHi Marko, it's great that you're working on a Slovenian extraction! In which way did you modify the extractors? Maybe we can add your changes to the repository. The definitions given directly in Wikipedia will be used for the live extraction (the group in Leipzig is working on that), while the definitions in the files are used to produce the dumps found on mapping.xls and rules.xls were replaced by mapping.csv and rules.csv. The first version of the CSV files contained the same data as the Excel files, but going forward from there, we only updated the CSV files. They use the same \"format\" - the columns have the same meanings as in the Excel files. They are described in dbpedia/ontology/docs/dbpedia_mapping.txt. When you open the CSV files with OpenOffice, you will be asked for the character encoding, field separator and text delimiter used in the file. Set the character encoding to UTF-8, the separator to \";\" (semicolon) and uncheck all other separators, and make sure that the text delimiter is empty (default is a quote). Similarly in Excel. When you adapt the mappings for the Slovenian Wikipedia, make sure that you only change the template URLs and template property names, but not the class names and ontology properties. The main reason for replacing the .xls file was that working with a binary format like .xls is hard. Finding the differences between different versions of such files is almost impossible, as is writing scripts that parse them. Our scripts that copy the mappings and rules to the database (dbpedia/ontology/mapping_db.php and dbpedia/ontology/rules_db.php) always worked on CSV files, which we had to export from OpenOffice or Excel first. Now we can avoid this extra step.

This requires a lot of changes in the code for a very small added value (like your case) and is not likely to be implemented soon. Unless of course someone from the community volunteers to help ;) Another approach for this specific case would be to gather similar templates and see if we can add them as parameters of the CategoryExtractor The first part here is to try and gather all similar templates, and if they get too many we should focus on the first and more genera approach.

For example, it might come really handy for what we are developing to have a list of things classified (or ordered) by the bdpedia-owl classe's names. So far I managed to get more or less what I intended: PREFIX owl: PREFIX dbo: PREFIX rdfs: SELECT ?className ?class ?name ?summary ?uri where { ?uri rdfs:label ?name ; rdfs:comment ?summary ; a ?class ; dbo:country . ?class rdfs:label ?className ; rdfs:subClassOf owl:Thing .

Because right now it works but maybe in the future other classes (besides from dbpedia-owl) are also subclass of thingin fact, what makes sense for me is that all concepts should be So right now I get the response with the labels of the classes in english because I'm guessing the onthology lacks any more labels for other languages. Question 2: If I add labels in portuguese to classes in the mappings wiki (like in here it show in the next release of DBpedia and in the public SPARQL end-point, so my query above returns also this portuguese names and I'm able to classify based on portuguese names of the classes? I saw I already got editor permissions in the wiki, thanks for that! Question 3: Is there a roadmap for DBpedia releases? Question 4: Is there any kind of inference going on when retrieving things from DBpedia so I can asume some things? (for example, that all writers are also persons, etc) Is there a way to refine this rules to add support for better inferences or better awareness of cross-onthology classification? In the portuguese case, it seems to me easier if there is way to say \"all the things being skos:subject are also dbpedia-owl:Writer\" than to try to edit one by one the articles so they end up being explicitly dbpedia-owl:Writer .

Responding to myself, I found this on the matter of inference/reasoning and categories: Haven't tried that yet, but I hope there is (or there will be) a more concise way of achieving the same. Still wondering if there is *ANY* inference going on in the process of quering DBpedia, and (if any) who and when it is done (when quering in the rdf store, when mapping wikipedia so it all becomes explicit and later there is no need for inference, etc). uInference is performed in backward-chaining fashion and optional. The DBpedia linksets are sometimes derived from a forward-chaining inference workflow. Only if inference context is enabled which is done by specifically using SPARQL pragmas to apply inference rules to SPARQL patterns. There are some pre-configured inference rules associated with the DBpedia instance which are visible via the interface at: can use \"Settings\" to select inference rules from a drop-down etcThe inference rules names can also be used in your Virtuoso SPARQL Query pragmas. Links: 1. SPARQL_Tutorials_Part_2.html uHi, Yes, it should be included in the next release. Also it will be available here: and here directly after you edit it (give or take some minutes) Now, here is the query that gives you the ontology from DBpedia-Live Note that its from a different graph. I'm also not sure, if all the Portuguese é è ã come out well, but we are working on it. PREFIX meta: CONSTRUCT {?s ?p ?o} FROM WHERE { ?b meta:origin meta:TBoxExtractor . ?b owl:annotatedSource ?s . ?b owl:annotatedProperty ?p . ?b owl:annotatedTarget ?o . FILTER(!(?p IN ( meta:editlink, meta:revisionlink, meta:oaiidentifier, ))).} cheers, Sebastian uThanks! I'll be doing testing on the live instance, which I just knew about yesterday it existed.

For example the dbpedia resource for < match it. DBpedia extracts information from Wikipedia, and if you edit the Wikipedia page for Wilmington, Delaware you will see that it uses the {{infobox settlement}} template but doesn't give a `settlement_type`, so DBpedia's mapping only calls it a generic Settlement uThank you Rob. I found there are a lot of relations between cities and states,so using OPTIONAL is my next step. Also, thank you very much for pointing out that some cities are not 'City' type in DBpedia. I certainly should look at that. As for another approach, if I change the wikipedia pages, how long it will take to transfer the change in DBpedia?

"Birthplaces query"	"uHi Stephen, Thanks for your interest in DBpedia. I send a copy of my answer to our discussion list [1] (you are very much invited to join), since it might be of interest for other members of the DBpedia community too. Yes it is! The DBpedia project offers a SPARQL endpoint [2] as well as a query builder [3]. Both can be used to answer queries like yours. I created a query using our query builder for you. You can review the result at: (Maybe someone else from the list creates a corresponding SPARQL query for you.) As you can see there are only 138 results :-( What's the reason? If you look at a query retrieving a list of people together with their birth dates, death dates and birth places we have 3487 results: There are around 50k places with longitude and latitude in DBpedia. The reason, why we unfortunately can not get both together with a simple query is, that the birth place of people often just contains a string representation (maybe sometimes including a reference/link) of the birth place. Hence, pattern matching techniques have to be applied to get more matching results. Unfortunately, I'm right now to busy to help with that, but you are invited to play around yourself and maybe someone else on the list is able to provide some support. Also, the improved datasets, which we hope to release soon might result in more precise query answering. Best regards, Sören [1] [2] [3] http://wikipedia.aksw.org"
"How do I query wikilinks?"	"uHi, I'm using: I ran this query: select ?from, ?to where { ?from dbpprop:wikilink ?to. } and received no results. I then saw that that predicate had been deprecated for some reason, so I tried its replacement: select ?from, ?to where { ?from dbpedia-owl:wikiPageWikiLink ?to. } This also gave me no results. Why? How do I query wikilinks? More generally, how can I see which predicates are available? I tried: select distinct ?pred where { ?from ?pred ?to. filter(regex(?pred, \"link\")). } But this also returns no results.

I guess statistical approach could mean two things: 1. heuristically figure out which format is used on a Wikipedia edition and use that format to parse all values 2. heuristically figure out which format is used for a certain template property and use that format to parse values for this property I don't think either would work well. For example, most numbers in the source text of decimal separator (as Portuguese texts usually do), but most values in the source text of dot. So we can't use one separator for all pages of a language, we have to treat specific properties differently. And I don't think there is a good way to figure out which format a property uses. In this case, we would have to figure out that Rio Rufino has an area of about 282 km², not ~ 282000 km². We might use a heuristic like 'cities usually have an area of less than 10000 km²', but such a heuristic might fail for either very large or very small cities, and we would have to introduce all kinds of different heuristics. I think it's much simpler to allow the editors of the mappings wiki to specify that a certain template property uses a format that differs from the main one for this Wikipedia edition.

It feels safer to use a different locale altogether than to modifiy separate aspects of a complex beast like a number format. Advantages: + Relatively simple to implement: add Locale constructor parameter in ParserUtils, use it when getting NumberFormat / DecimalFormat. Four data parser and three mapping classes will also need this constructor parameter. The MappingsLoader will have to parse the mappings wiki settings. For the other solutions, we would either need two (or maybe three) instead of one parameter, or construct our own NumberFormat from the decimalSeparator and groupingSeparator (and possibly other) property settings. + Compact setting: one setting like \"en\" changes all separators, not just the decimalSeparator. If decimalSeparator and groupingSeparator can be set separately, editors will probably forget one or the other, which will lead to problems. We could add implicit rules like \"if the editor set the decimalSeparator to comma but no groupingSeparator, set groupingSeparator to dot\" and vice versa, which is ugly and confusing. Disadvantages: - Possibly more difficult for mappings wiki editors. The difference between comma and dot is plain to see, but that these characters are connected to a thing called 'locale' is less obvious. - Less flexible. If there ever is a property that uses decimalSeparator, groupingSeparator and maybe other settings not covered by any Locale, we're in trouble. I think (but we should collect hard data about this) that there are mainly two cases: numbers that use comma as decimalSeparator (and dot or space as groupingSeparator), or vice versa: dot as decimalSeparator (and comma or space as groupingSeparator). Most template properties in a Wikipedia language edition should use the format that is 'canonical' for that language. The others will probably use the 'English' format. Space as groupingSeparator is already allowed for all languages. Java doesn't support it, but I recently added that behavior to ParserUtils.parse().

"PhD Scholarship Opportunity on Visualisation of Expressive Ontologies at Monash University, Australia"	"uApologies for cross posting. ==PhD Scholarship Opportunity on Visualisation of Expressive Ontologies at Monash University, Australia== The Opportunity Applications are invited for a funded PhD scholarship position at Monash University, Australia. The successful candidate will perform research in the junction of information visualisation, bioinformatics, and the Semantic Web. The candidate will work under the supervision of Prof. Falk Schreiber and Dr. Yuan-Fang Li at the Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University. The Gene Ontology (GO) [1] is one of the most widely used biomedical ontologies. It comprehensively describes different aspects of genes and gene products under three broad categories, (1) biological process, (2) cellular components and (3) molecular functions. GO is currently being actively extended in the LEGO project to create a new annotation system to provide more extensible and expressive annotations. This project aims to investigating novel visualisation techniques for GO-LEGO and its integration with the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) [2]. The information can be seen as networks, and although there are some solutions for network layout, none is particularly tailered towards this application. Specifically we will investigate how domain knowledge captured in ontologies can assist in creating high-quality layouts.

Many more to come as part of our effort to put the entire LOD cloud into a Virtuoso 6.0 Cluster Edition. Links: 1. inside Virtuoso) 2. Cache is pretty cold, so a few query hits are required for general warm up. Also, we haven't set the 2-3 second response time ceiling, so any queries presented right now are executed without the \"anytime query\" feature. We've decided not to impose the server side ceiling until we've update the UI. Once done, users (UI or Web Service API) can then configure their response time factors within a floor and ceiling range set on the server. Thus, the moment you see the options in the UI you can safely assume the response time floor and ceiling settings are in place on the server. For those interested in URI lookups, as per my last mail about this matter, you can search on: Telemann, then use Types to filter out the types of entities associated with the pattern and then use properties to get you to your desired entity/object/resource which will naturally expose a URI / Entity ID. You can also search on \"Napoleon\" and ultimately see a map (note. the navigation section drop-down) that will plot locations of conflicts associated with the entity \"Napoleon\"."

"Announcing Virtuoso Open-Source Edition v 6.1.0"	"uHi, OpenLink Software is pleased to announce the official release of Virtuoso Open-Source Edition, Version 6.1.0: IMPORTANT NOTEfor up-graders from pre-6.x versions: The database file format has substantially changed between VOS 5.x and VOS 6.x. To upgrade your database, you must dump all data from the VOS 5.x database and re-load it into VOS 6.x. Complete instructions may be found here. IMPORTANT NOTEfor up-graders from earlier 6.x versions: The database file format has not changed, but the introduction of a newer RDF index requires you run a script to upgrade the RDF_QUAD table. Since this can be a lengthy task and take extra disk space (up to twice the space used by the original RDF_QUAD table may be required during conversion) this is not done automatically on startup. Complete instructions may be found here. New and updated product features include: * Database engine - Added new 2+3 index scheme for RDF_QUAD table - Added new inlined string table for RDF_QUAD - Added optimizations to cost based optimizer - Added RoundRobin connection support - Removed deprecated samples/demos - Fixed align buffer to sizeof pointer to avoid crash on strict checking platforms like sparc - Fixed text of version mismatch messages - Fixed issue with XA exception, double rollback, transact timeout - Merged enhancements and fixes from V5 branch * SPARQL and RDF - Added support for owl:inverseOf, owl:SymmetricProperty, and owl:TransitiveProperty. - Added DB.DBA.BEST_LANGMATCH() and bif_langmatches_pct_http() - Added initial support for SPARQL-FED - Added initial support for SERVICE { }; - Added support for expressions in LIMIT and OFFSET clauses - Added built-in predicate IsRef() - Added new error reporting for unsupported syntax - Added rdf box id only serialization; stays compatible with 5/6 - Added support for SPARQL INSERT DATA / DELETE DATA - Added SPARQL 1.1 syntax sugar re. HAVING CLAUSE for filtering on GROUP BY - Added special code generator for optimized handling of: SPARQL SELECT DISTINCT ?g WHERE { GRAPH ?g { ?s ?p ?o } } - Added support for HTML+RDFa representation re. output from SPARQL CONSTRUCT and DESCRIBE queries - Added support for output:maxrows - Improved SPARQL parsing and SQL codegen for negative numbers - Improved recovery of lists in DB.DBA.RDF_AUDIT_METADATA() - Fixed iSPARQL compatibility with 3rd party SPARQL endpoints - Fixed bad init in trans node if multiple inputs or step output values - Fixed redundant trailing '>' in results of TTL load when IRIs contain special chars - Fixed problem with rfc1808_expand_uri not using proper macros and allocate byte extra for strings - Fixed when different TZ is used, find offset and transform via GMT - Fixed graph-level security in cluster - Fixed redundant equalities in case of multiple OPTIONALs with same variable - Fixed BOOLEAN_OF_OBJ in case of incomplete boxes - Fixed NTRIPLES serialization of triples - Merged enhancements and fixes from V5 branch * Sponger Middleware - Added Extractor Cartridges mapping Zillow, O'Reilly, Amazon, Googlebase, BestBuy, CNET, and Crunchbase content to the GoodRelations Ontology. - Added Extractor Cartridges for Google Spreadsheet, Google Documents, Microsoft Office Docs (Excel, PowerPoint etc), OpenOffice, CSV, Text files, Disqus, Twitter, and Discogs. - Added Meta Cartridges covering Google Search, Yahoo!

"Announcement: DBpedia 3.1 Release"	"uHello, hereby we announce the 3.1 release of DBpedia. As always, downloads are available at [1] and the list of changes since DBpedia 3.0 is in our changelog [2]. Some notable improvements are a much better YAGO mapping, providing a more complete (more classes assigned to instances) and accurate (95% accuracy) class hierarchy for DBpedia. The Geo extractor code has been improved and is now run for all 14 languages. URI validation has switched to the PEAR validation class. Overall, we now provide 6.0 GB (58,4 GB uncompressed) of downloadable nt and csv files. The triple count (excluding pagelinks) has surpassed the 100 million barrier and is now at 116.7 million triples, which is an increase of 27% compared to DBpedia 3.0. The extraction was performed on a server of the AKSW [3] research group. I would like to thank Sören Auer, Jörg Schüppel, Chris Bizer, Richard Cyganiak, Georgi Kobilarov, Christian Becker, the OpenLink team, and all other contributors for their DBpedia support. Kind regards, Jens Lehmann [1] [2] [3] http://aksw.org"
"Linking to the Norwegian Company Registry"	"uHi, in general, what is the process to get new extraction functionality added to dbpedia? Do I submit a feature request and wait and hope, or should I write code and propose it for inclusion in the extraction framework? More concretely: we are in the process of publishing lots of interesting information about Norwegian companies and organisations, taken from the official national registry ( linked data. This will be RDF data based on daily dumps of the registry. We will obviously try to link our data to dbpedia, but we think it would be cool to have dbpedia link to up-to-date information from the company register. In many cases, this shouldn't be too hard: Norwegian organisations are identified by a unique 9 digit \"organisation number,\" which will be part of the URIs of organisations. These organisation numbers are stated on many Norwegian wikipedia pages, either in an infobox as \"Org. nummer 123 456 789\" (see e.g. part of an external reference to \"Nøkkelopplysninger fra Enhetsregisteret\" (see e.g. ref 3 on the same page). In the latter case, the link goes to an info page created by the company registry, based on an organisation number in the URI. In other words, creating e.g. owl:sameAs triples for companies where the Norwegian wikipedia page gives an org. number should be easy. For those pages which don't yet give the org. number, it would be an extra incentive to add such information. So back to the start: what would be necessary to make this work? Yours, Martin uOn Wed, Feb 15, 2012 at 9:39 AM, Martin Giese < > wrote: I think the semantics of an external reference are much too loose to do anything useful with. Using infobox data is more reliable, but you should still be cautious about cases where the infobox doesn't refer to the same entity as the page that hosts it does. To make up an example, where a person who's the managing director of a company has an infobox for the company on his page. It may sound unlikely, but Wikipedia is riddled with stuff like this. Failing to identify cases where this happens will cause bad assertions to be made which will ripple downstream to cause contradictory inferences. Tom uHi, and thanks for your reply, Tom! On 2012-02-15 20:16, Tom Morris wrote: In general, I agree. But it would be possible to double check using the organization's name. Usually, the name in the register will be the same as the title of the Norwegian Wikipedia page. Again, using the name as additional identification should help here. Norway has the additional advantage of being so small that only a few hundred companies, organizations, and institutions are present on Wikipedia. (At least with an org. nr. For the rest, we have little hope of linking them up) Therefore, a manual quality check seems entirely possible. Martin uThere is always the option of creating another extractor and sending us a pull request. For your case, though, it would be an extremelly specialized extractor, with little chances of being reused by others. If many people start creating those, they become hard to maintain. I would say that the best solution would be to create mappings for all templates that you need uOn Thu, Feb 16, 2012 at 4:11 AM, Martin Giese < > wrote: Wikipedia categories tend to be pretty noisy (at least in English Wikipedia), but if you can get a reasonable set of candidates, the list sounds like it would be small enough that you could use Google Refine and the OpenCorporates reconciliation service for Refine to discover any missing registry numbers. Alternatively, you could use the DERI RDF extension and your triplified registry database to do the reconciliation directly against that (I think. I haven't done this personally). The RDF extension can also be used to generate RDF if you wanted to produce your owl:sameAs triples that way, although that's probably not a good workflow for anything other than a one-time effort.

To make that easier, I added Template:Label [5] and Template:Comment [6] and added code to OntologyLoader.scala that parses them. Instead of \"rdfs: =foo\", please use {{label|en|foo}} in the future. Similar for comments. See the documentation of the ontology templates [1][2][3][4] for details. And please, whenever you edit an ontology item, change it to the new format for labels and comments.

"DBpedia properties"	"uHi all, I am doing my thesis to get my B.Sc. I.T. (Hons) degree. As part of my Final Year Project (which is the thesis itself) I am investigating how use of ontologies could be made to help users bookmark webpages. I would like to use dbpedia as a kind of a 'universal ontology' in such a way that the bookmark file structure would be like the 'natural order of things'. Essentially, I was thinking of implementing something like this. Each web page would be represented by its most important topics while a category would be represented by its name. I would then like to query dbpedia to see if there exist a relationship between any of the topics and the category name. I would like to know which of the 8000 dbpedia relationships are most relevant to my task. I need relationships like skos:subject or perhaps rdf:type but I guess you guys could give me better advice since you know exactly what they mean. Also, how am I to get to the actual resource from the category name or the page topic. Will rdfs:label work? Thanks for your co-operation, uHi Savio, Sounds interesting. Yes, you could do this by querying the DBpedia SPARQL endpoint. See: Sorry, the relationships were extracted by automated algorithms from Wikipedia, so we also do not know what they exactly mean and you have to explore the dataset yourself to find the relevant parts. We are providing three different classification schemata for DBoedia entities, which could be good starting points for your work. See You get the resource by simply dereferencing its URI. There are rdfs:labels in different languages, so you should be fine. Please keep us up-to-date on how your work progresses. Cheers Chris"

So here goes my point of view: When Wikidata was started, I hoped it would quickly become a major contributor of quality data to the LOD cloud. But although the project has a potentially massive crowd and is backed by Wikimedia, it does not really care about the Linked Data paradigm as established in the Semantic Web. RDF is more of an afterthought than a central concept. It was a bit disappointing to see that Wikidata's impact on the LOD community is lacking because of this. Now Freebase will be integrated into Wikidata as a curated, Google engineering hardened knowledge base not foreign to RDF and Linked Data. How the integration will be realized is not yet clear it seems. One consequence is hopefully, that the LOD cloud grows by a significant amount of quality data. But I wonder what the consequences for the DBpedia project will be? If Wikimedia gets their own knowledge graph, possible curated by their crowd, where is the place for the DBpedia? Can DBpedia stay relevant with all the problems of an open source project, all the difficulties with mapping heterogeneous data in many different languages, the resulting struggle with data quality and consistency and so on? So I propose being proactive about it: I see a large problem of the DBpedia with restrictions of the RDF data model. Triples limit our ability to make statements about statements. I cannot easily address a fact in the DBpedia and annotate it. This means: -I cannot denote the provenance of a statement. I especially cannot denote the source data it comes from. Resource level provenance is not sufficient if further datasets are to be integrated into DBpedia in the future. -I cannot denote a timespan that limits the validity of a statement. Consider the fact that Barack Obama is the president of the USA. This fact was not valid at a point in the past and won't be valid at some point in the future. Now I might link the DBpedia page of Barack Obama for this fact. Now if a DBpedia version is published after the next president of the USA was elected, this fact might be missing from the DBpedia and my link becomes moot. -This is a problem with persistency. Being able to download old dumps of DBpedia is not a sufficient model of persistency. The community struggles to increase data quality, but as soon as a new version is published, it drops some of the progress made in favour of whatever facts are found in the Wikipedia dumps at the time of extraction. The old facts should persist, not only in some dump files, but as linkable data. Being able to address these problems would also mean being able to fully import Wikidata, including provenance statements and validity timespans, and combine it with the DBpedia ontology (which already is an important focus of development and rightfully so). It also means a persistent DBpedia that does not start over in the next version. So how can it be realized? With reification of course! But most of us resent the problems reification brings with it, the complications in querying etc. The reification model itself is also unclear. There are different proposals, blank nodes, reification vocabulary, graph names, creating unique subproperties for each triple etc. Now I won't propose using one of these models, this will surely be subject to discussion. But the DBpedia can propose a model and the LOD community will adapt, due to DBpedia's state and impact. I think it is time to up the standard of handling provenance and persistence in the LOD cloud and DBpedia should make the start. Especially in the face of Freebase and Wikidata merging, I believe it is imperative for the DBpedia to move forward. regards, Martin [1] bu3z2wVqcQc uHi Martin We discussed this issue a bit in the developer hangout, sadly to few people are usually present.

We've had a similar need in one of the applications we developed, reified statements were simply impractical due to their verbosity and performance impact. The solution we came up with was using N-quads to use the 4th quad as an ID for an index. By looking up the ID you can find out information regarding provenance, time etc. I think this is more of a Graph Database problem. We should look at ways it can be implemented effectively in RDF-stores and then propose modifications to the RDF/Sparql standard if needed. Maybe the people from OpenLink or other RDF-Store researchers have some ideas on this issue. Cheers, Alexandru [1] [2] [3] Leipzig2014 uBut you can. Make an IntermediateNode (e.g. Barack_Obama1) and put what you will there. This is used all the time for CareerPost, the association node between a player and a team, etc. Political positions in many wikis are modeled with a lot of shopistication Position1: title, country/region/city/ from which party, etc Term11: which (1,2,3), from, to Colleague111: title (e.g. vicePresident), from, to Colleague112: title, from, to Term21 Position 2 Term21 Colleague211 The best you can map this to (for someone X) is X careerPost X_1: Postion1(title); Term11(from-to); coleague , . X careerPost X_2: Postion1(title) & Term12(from-to) X careerPost X_3: Position2; Term 21; colleague What you cannot map is point to an IntermediateNode of the colleague, and map the from/to of colleagues. (And you can only map their position's title if you use subprops, e.g. vicePresident uHi Martin, how daring that you started this discussion :D I just want to put my 2 cents in it. I think you are mixing things up. Wikipedia, DBpedia, Wikidata, and Freebase are more or less standalone projects. Some are synced, depending, or partially imported into another. But, there is no need and no use of fully importing Wikidata into DBpedia! Better get an RDF dump of Wikidata. The intended import of Freebase data to Wikidata will hardly be complete. One reason is that Freebase has no references of single facts to a particular source, which is a requirement for claims in Wikidata. I.e. unfortunately Freebase will never become imported to Wikidata completely. Freebase has its own community of contributors that provide and link facts into the knowledge base. Freebases biggest advantage is the easy import of own data. Time will show how this is adapted to Wikidata. Opposite there is DBpedia, which (currently) does not support manipulating A-Box facts. As Alexandru said, DBpedia is about extraction. Am 27.01.2015 um 13:46 schrieb Alexandru Todor < >: Indeed DBpedia community should think about a roadmap for future developments. I do not see any problem with restrictions of the RDF data model as a data exchange framework. But I admit there are some limitations with managing changes and also provenance. However, that is not relevant for most applications that want to work with this data. As Alexandru said, N-quads can be a solution for this. DBpedia extraction framework already supports multiple datasets, at least one for each extraction step. Actually I dont know whether they are currently delivered or that is behind Virtuosos capabilities. Roles in time can also be represented by intermediate role instances. Freebase does that similarly, e.g. [ Speaking about modeling entities in time (and space) and since you are in Leipzig, I strongly recommend \"Ontologie für Informationssysteme - Vorlesung (H.Herre)\" [ DBpedia already supports Memento, which is an accepted standard for Linked Data. DBpedia versions are going back to 3.0. Let me know, if you are interested in this. A student of mine is working on that currently. Proposing best practice, models, technologies, and vocabularies for the LOD is definitely an imperative for DBpedia since it has been a central element and reference for a long time and should be further on. Best Magnus uMartin, When I first started working with RDF, I didn't fully \"get\" the full expressivity of it. All of the things you are saying can't be done (perhaps, easily?) are quite simple to implement. When compared to the property graph model, RDF, at first glance, seems inferior, but in reality, is much more expressive, in my opinion. Through reification, you can express all of the concepts that you are wanting to (provenance, date ranges, etc). At the end of the day, RDF's expressivity comes at the cost of verbosity, which, in my opinion is well worth it. If you would like some help in modeling your graph to represent the missing concepts that you are after, I will be happy to help you out with some more specific examples and pointers if it would be helpful to you. Aaron uDBpedia has a mission that is focused around extracting data from Wikipedia. Importing data wholesale from Wikidata or something like that seems to be inconsistent with that mission, but there are all kinds of temporal and provenance things that could be teased out of Wikipedia, if not out of the Infoboxes. I think most query scenarios are going to work like this [Pot of data with provenance information] -> [Data Set Representing a POV] -> query I've been banging my head on the temporal aspect for a while and I am convinced that the practical answer to a lot of problems is to replace times with time intervals. Intervals can be used to model duration and uncertainty and the overloading between those functions is not so bad because usually you know from the context what the interval is being used to represent. There is a lot of pain right now if you want to work with dates from either DBpedia or Freebase because different kinds of dates are specified to different levels of detail. If you make a plot of people's birthdays in Freebase for instance you find a lot of people born on Jan 1 I think because that is something 'plausible' to put in. A \"birth date\" could be resolved to a short interval (I know was I born at 4:06 in the afternoon) and astrologers would like to know that, but the frequent use of a calendar day is a statement about imprecision, although defining my \"birthday\" as a set of one day intervals the interval is reflecting a social convention. Anyway, there is an algebra over time intervals that is well accepted and could be implemented either as a native XSD data type or by some structure involving \"blank\" nodes.

Aaron Bossert < > wrote: uPaul, The date ranges are doableI would say that one can still work either as-isand working with differing levels of specificityif you work with the dates as they are Aaron uWell, I got to Allen's algebra of intervals because I was concerned about how to deal with all of the different date time formats that are specified in XSD. All of these can be treated, correctly, as either an interval or a set of intervals. Note there are modelling issues that go beyond this. For instance, I still say we retain the birth date and death date properties even though you could model somebody's life as an interval. There are lots of practical reasons, but one of them is that I know my life is not an open ended interval although it looks like that now. Using this is a practical theory of time I can usually figure out what I need to know. I can say, however, if a person has a birthdate in Freebase of Jan 1, X, odds are far less than 0.5 that the person was born on that day. Thus, if I want to say anything abut people born on Jan 1, X and not look like a fool, I need to go through those facts and figure out which ones I believe. Thus, in some cases the data is really broken and energy must be spent to overcome entropy. On Tue, Jan 27, 2015 at 1:05 PM, M.

That is, you need provenance metadata not so much to say \"These great population numbers for county X are from the world bank (and if you look closely they linearly interpolate between censuses which could be ten or more years apart\") but more to say \"User Z asserted 70,000 bogus triples\" On Tue, Jan 27, 2015 at 1:43 PM, Martin BrÃ¼mmer < > wrote: uHi Magnus, Am 27.01.2015 um 15:12 schrieb Magnus Knuth: Well, I just felt like stirring up the community a bit so people have something to argue about while sitting in Dublin's beautiful pubs ;) I'm not so sure about that. From a LOD users perspective, the idea of a place that integrates encyclopedic knowledge in a comprehensive way with high quality is very attractive to me. I'm not alone with that, evidenced by DBpedia's central place in the LOD cloud. RDF dumps are not very easy and reliable to handle and most importantly not linked data. You might be right that Freebase can not be completely merged into Wikidata and that all projects will coexist in their own niche. However, I believe that even then it is a worthwhile cause to tackle triple level provenance, modelling time constraints and persistence of facts throughout DBpedia versions. It's interesting that you bring up manipulating A-Box facts. If we could address individual triples, making statements about them, including their validity and possibly correcting them indivdually without the change being lost after the next conversion could be possible. One might argue that these changes should be done directly in the Wikipedia, but this sometimes implies bureaucracy with Wikipedia editors that I would like to avoid. regards, Martin uOn 1/27/15 1:43 PM, Martin Brümmer wrote: Martin, DBpedia isn't *endangered*.

Also check out the SPARQL endpoint which contains an interactive query editor. I would like the DBPedia community to consider making Graphity the default Linked Data interface.

But it could be uI am a human being clicking on this and as such I expect something human readable. If you are going to show me a 404 I am going to interpret that as \"the system is broken\" rather than anything else. That is one of the reasons why semantic web gets so much scorn and anger from people who are not \"die hard\" members of the community or not graduate students in an academic system where you need to fit into a particular idiosyncratic culture to survive. You find this attitude all over the place, even at places like OMG, which does a lot of things that are complementary (and unfortunately parallel) to the W3C. For instance on this page you see a link to an OWL ontology if there was an \"it just works\" culture, you could point Protoge at this URL and it would load the ontology, but no, people couldn't make up their collective minds about what means, so you need to manually add the URIs for 10 or so imports in order to do this. If the C language or any of the thousands of other languages that have something like in them had unclear semantics about how to find the files you are importing, we would not be programming in C today, we just wouldn't. OWL has enough problems without stupid little things like this. (To be fair, just try loading the XMI files with the version of Eclipse that is recommended by the OMG and it is also not a \"it just works\" process.) There is another respected vendor in the semweb space that has an excellent triple store that has a \"biomedical browser\" that gives no results on searches like \"omeprazole\" or \"aspirin\" or \"cocaine\". People don't get excited about it, it is just another semweb demo that doesn't work. The difference between the semweb community and most of the others (say the people who post to \"Show HN\") is in most communities you click on a link and get a \"404\" it is perceived to be the responsibility of the person who is showing, and not a matter of blaming the end user or the upstream supply chain or anything else.)

This is understandable, since they are already storing the Wikipedia URLs, and it would seem like duplicating a really significant part of the overall data. There are similar issues with most of the other identifiers: they are usually the main IDs of the database, not the URIs of the corresponding RDF data (if available). For example, the Freebase ID of TimBL is \"/m/07d5b\" but the URI would be \" The community is in a tricky situation there, since most datasets do not use URIs as their primary IDs (which you need to find something on the site).

I've personally asked you several times the last 1+ years to deploy the new interface to dbpedia.org is this is the reason you didn't so far? If you want to go with a competition I really don't mind. Here's two requirements from my side: 1) the new interface implements the triple action framework we introduced in our interface (see the paper for details) 2) there is a clear and easy way to deploy updates ps1.

"GSoC: Programming languages"	"uHello everyone, I am considering applying to Google Summer of Code, particularly in Spotting task for DBpedia Spotlight. The problem is that I know Java well and work with it every day, but have never written a single line in Scala and barely heard about it. I've spent quite a while browsing the Spotlight code and still can't figure out, what's the rule - why some parts of the code are written in Scala and others in Java? Even small modules are split into two parts. Of course I'd like to take GSoC as an occasion to learn new, surprisingly popular language, and also expect myself to be able to read other's Scala code, but would definitely prefer to write my own in Java. Will it be a problem? Thanks, Piotr uHi Piotr, Let's continue this discussion at the correct list for DBpedia Spotlight: dbp-spotlight-developers. The codebase is mixed because we learned Scala while creating DBpedia Spotlight. I personally regret not jumping straight into Scala, as the system is not as smooth as it could because of that. We also accepted contributions in Java, and that ended up in the codebase. In the future we would like to move everything into Scala, but if your application is great, we could live with you writing in Java.

"Weaker coupling please in configuration"	"uI just brought my Spotlight up to date and had a lot of breakage in my configuration file because of things like this //TODO use separate candidate map candidateMapDirectory = config.getProperty(\"org.dbpedia.spotlight.candidateMap.dir\").trim(); if(!new File(candidateMapDirectory).isDirectory()) { //throw new ConfigurationException(\"Cannot find candidate map directory \"+ candidateMapDirectory); } LOG.info(\"Read candidateMap.dir, but not used in this version.\"); I get a null pointer exception because I don't define this property, which must point to a real directory. The big joke is that this is \"not used in this version\" so it's another nonworking artifact that gets people confused when they start working with Spotlight. Spotlight might benefit from dependency injection or another advanced approach to configuration, but it would help a lot to wrap code like the above in an existence check so I don't need to maintain a whole bunch of bogus configuration parameters that the system doesn't use! uPaul, Fair rant to the wrong list. :) Answer follows, but let's move the discussion. A long time ago we decided to use trunk as the live dev branch, and tags to mark stable points. When in time pressure, we (mostly I) end up committing snippets that were added for temporary tests, or for new features that aren't already finished, and shouldn't have made it to SVN. If you want a stable copy, please feel free to use tag/release-0.4 We are moving to git soon, where it will be easier to manage branches away from trunk. This little parameter is for a new feaure that was, in fact, requested by you, but that we did not have time to fully include for this release. You can now decide to load the candidate map in memory, but you still need to touch code for that. It is a working artifact that is not fully configurable yet. And yes, I got spoiled by Scala that doesn't return \"surprise nulls\", rather using the much more elegant Option. Forgot to test for that one null, and it shouldn't throw with the config file committed, so thank you for testing it with an outdated config so that I can remove this bug. About dependency injection, yes, we admit that configuration/dependency management in DBpedia Spotlight needs work. Please feel free to contribute that to the project.

"Using other languages infoboxes"	"uI am curious how dbpedia extracts information from infoboxes from non-english language pages. For example, here are 2 pages about the same historical figure in English and Russian: Russian page is more complete for obvious reasons. Its infobox contains information about father, mother, date of birth, death, wife. This information is not available in dbpedia at What stops dbpedia software from extracting this information? Is it just question of doing some translation or there are more complicated problems? uHi Alexey, yes, combining information from infoboxes in different languages would be great, but also get's extremely tricky. First there is the problem of translation. Second, there is the problem of contradictions. What you do with 20 different population figures for Berlin? Take the German one? Take the English one? Take the last updated one? Take the average? A completely open question is, wheather there are heuristics for this that can be applied to all properties or if you would need different heuristics for different properties? I would guess the last. So next question: What are good heuristics? What are good heuristics for deciding which heuristic to use one which property? So lots of open reseach questions and a big invitation for you to get active in this field ;-) Cheers Chris uOn 9/6/07, Chris Bizer < > wrote: For Berlin population I'd probably go with German one :-) I'd guess so Yes, you are right of course. I just hoped you already did hard work and just want some help with translation :-) I guess a lot of manual work would be required, this is probably another reason why Freebase is useful. I afraid my day job does not leave much time for it. I am interested in it as hobby, let's see how far it'll take me. I am still trying to understand the technology. Thanks! uChris Bizer wrote: I think besides to delve into these questions it would be great, if we could just perform the infobox extraction on different language versions and publish the extracted datasets separately. This should be fairly easy to do - can you guys in Berlin try or should I discuss this with Jens and Jörg here in Leipzig? This would also be a great basis for investigating the mentioned questions and often it might be simply reasonable to just take information from the English infobox extraction if available and from some other if not. Cheers, Sören uHi Sören, Yes, it would make sence to extract these datasets and provide them seperately for donwload. Technically, it should be easy. Just define a new extraction job that runs the infobox extractor over the different dumps. I think interesting questions that arise are: 1. Should you prefix property names with some language identifier in order to allow different infobox dataset to be loaded into the same store and still avoid name collisions and be able to track where different property values came from? I would say yes and maybe do something like dbpedia:property/de_plz as we don't know if plz means something else in Kroatian. 2. How to name resources? Many resource appear in different languages, some resources only apprear in a single Wiki. In order to keep the number of URIs low and to be able to easyly merge data from different languages, I would propose to keep on using the English article name as primary identifier for all languages and only add new identifiers for articles that only exist in specific non-English languages. Stuff like dbpedia:resource/de_RestaurantXYZinKreuzberg. What do you think? Georgi is moving to Bristol next week to work for half a year at HP Labs. Piet is busy with his master thesis. Therefore, it would be great, if Jens and Jörg could look into this. Could be an approach that is clearly worth testing. Cheers, Chris uHi all Indeed. It raises the question to know if the \"same\" wikipedia article in different languages have the \"same\" subject, and again how this \"sameness\" should be asserted in RDF. Wikipedia sameness of the article subject across languages versions is asserted by interwiki links, but this sameness is quite weak. Having different figures for Berlin population is less evil, it does not question the fact that both english and german articles more or less agree they speak about the same thing. There will be a lot of cases where more conflicting assertions will be found across languages versions, including the fact that two different articles in a language can link to only one in another language, etc. So, if dbpedia defines two distinct resources, such as How will you assert their sameness? Using owl:sameAs again is the more obvious way, but with expected inconsistencies, and automatic merging of information that we would like to keep distinct. Say we use some \"wiki:equivalent\" property and \"wiki:language\" to assert the language of the description - and that's where having languages as resources is interesting. wiki:language wiki:language wiki:equivalent One can use such triples to set SPARQL queries such as : what is the population of Berlin according to different versions of wikipedia? If resources are made distinct as above, seems that such collisions can be avoided. See above. Keeping the number of URIs and triples low is a trade-off vs seeking semantic accurracy. Again, if you want to be able to set queries with languages parameters, you need to have distinct resources for distinct languages, and languages as resources you can put as SPARQL variables BTW, I figured that various semantic browsers, Tabulator and Openlink as well, ciurrently somehow ignore the language labels. Meaning that the reflexion on multilingual aspects of the SW is yet in its infancy uHi all, In my opinion it's not reasonable to do our generic extraction on all languages and mix all results. It already is difficult for developers to find the right properties to use for a query, because there are ambiguous. For example we have three different properties describing the place of birth of a person, and let's imagine how that would look like with all languages. As it might be interesting for some developers like Alexey to have infobox data extracted from other languages we should provide that datasets, but separate from the main dataset. I'd suggest to follow the Wikipedia path with that and use language specific URIs, like from the German Wikipedia or Berlin from the Italian Wikipedia. These resources can be linked to the \"main\" resource-URI by whatever predicate. Another thing is matching specific infoboxes from other languages to the main dataset. If the Person Infobox template from Russian Wikipedia contains nice data about relations between persons, then we could deal with that like we did with the German Persondata template: We create a template-specific extractor which uses the main predicate vocabulary. Maybe we should think about processes to make this specific template extraction easier, but we should not mess things up by throwing everything together. Cheers, Georgi"

What you could try is to visit the YAGO website [1] and try to find out whether the number of buildings in YAGO itself is higher than in DBpedia. Let us know if you get any insights.

"Stable DBpedia IRIs"	"uDear DBpedia developers and users, the DBpedia URI for a Wikipedia page simply uses the page's title. If the page is renamed on Wikipedia, the DBpedia URI changes. But cool URIs don't change. [1] What can we do? Here's a simple solution: Use the Wikipedia page ID. When a Wikipedia page is renamed, only its title changes, not its page ID. So to have more stable URIs, we should (additionally) generate URIs based on the page ID. (When a Wikipedia page is deleted and later re-created, the page ID changes, but that is much rarer than renaming.) There are a few questions: uDear JC, let's not duplicate effort.

This results in both identifiers although MediaWiki treats them the same. See [1] and [2] that integrate the PageLinks versions into the rest of the datasets.

The current ontology file can be found here: Be aware that a new version is coming up: Christopher uHello Kenny I'll try to show that your question can have different levels of answer depending on interpretation, all of them based on SPARQL queries altogether. As others have suggested, you can query the ontology level for properties of which Company class is the domain, by submitting the following at PREFIX rdfs: SELECT DISTINCT ?p WHERE {?p rdfs:domain } This gets the following list of properties. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/areaServed http://dbpedia.org/ontology/divisions http://dbpedia.org/ontology/footnotes http://dbpedia.org/ontology/locationcountry http://dbpedia.org/ontology/marketcap http://dbpedia.org/ontology/netincome http://dbpedia.org/ontology/operatingincome This is pretty straightforward, but you get only properties directly and exclusively attached to Company class through the rdfs:domain declaration. Other properties might be inherited from Company superclasses, named or constructed (such as unionOf classes) or locally attached to this class using OWL restrictions. Not sure the latter happens in the dbpedia ontology, but you can e.g. query for properties of which domain is a Company superclass. PREFIX rdfs: SELECT DISTINCT ?p WHERE { ?p rdfs:domain ?x. rdfs:subClassOf ?x } And you get a few more properties http://dbpedia.org/ontology/foundationplace http://dbpedia.org/ontology/keyPersonPosition http://dbpedia.org/ontology/product http://dbpedia.org/ontology/foundationdate http://dbpedia.org/ontology/foundationorganisation http://dbpedia.org/ontology/keyPerson http://dbpedia.org/ontology/foundationperson http://dbpedia.org/ontology/numberOfEmployees But this is only the ontology level and one might wonder which of the above are actually used in DBpedia *instances*. To figure it out, just try the following PREFIX rdfs: SELECT DISTINCT ?p WHERE { ?x a . ?x ?p ?y } and get the surprise to find out more than 1000 different properties actually used to describe companies, meaning that, to paraphrase Hamlet, there is more in heaven and earth instances than is dreamt of in the model philosophy. Why so? Some properties in this list such as \"length\" are indeed weird for a company, so you might want to look for Companies having a length PREFIX rdfs: SELECT DISTINCT ?x ?y WHERE { ?x a . ?x ?y } Among the list you find e.g., < http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orion_International>. And if you look at the description of that one, you find indeed that it has a length, but also a width and a height. Well, strange indeed, but looking further down the description you find the following values for rdf:type dbpedia-owl:MeanOfTransportation dbpedia-owl:Company dbpedia-owl:Resource dbpedia-owl:Automobile dbpedia-owl:Organisation It figures. If you are both Company and Automobile, strange things are bound to happen to you. Hoping this little excursion will help you understand better, on one hand the power of SPARQL, and on the other hand that DBpedia is far from being a consistent set of data. In an open world, the question \"What properties can a Company have?\" has no unique answer. Bernard 2009/10/22 Jona Christopher Sahnwaldt < > uHello Bernard, very nice analysis!

If there is enough detailed information for the product \"Orion VII Next Generation\" to fill an infobox, this product IMO (with my Wikipedian hat on) deserves its own article. Meanwhile if there is more than one infobox in a page, take into account only the infobox of which title matches the article title seems to me a good heuristic. I don't think it's a good idea to create an URI for the additional subject, likely to clash with some other URIs. Suppose the product is called \"Bellatrix\" or \"Betelgeuse\", and you are into trouble.

I'm afraid we won't be able to change that. Good idea! But we'd have to relax that rule somewhat. In it's strict form, that rule would drop between 5 and 30 percent (rough estimate) of all articles.

Also, the fact that the information in infoboxes is (semi-)structured doesn't make it correct. I was reviewing language infoboxes the other day and came across a bunch where the author had apparently decided that having blank fields was bad, so if there was an iso3 code, but not iso2 code, they'd instead use the iso2 code for the language's language family. Saying these practices are \"bad\" is unlikely to have any effect. The authors of those articles are writing for humans, not computers, and a human can instantly tell what the relationship is between the infobox(es) and the article or, slightly less reliably, why a fact that isn't really true was substituted for an empty field Tom"

Cheers, Georgi uI think this is already handled. I am working in Java and the code is: HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection(); con.setRequestProperty(\"Accept\", \"application/rdf+xml\"); con.connect(); InputStream is = con.getInputStream(); and then some Jena calls that load the triples from the InputStream in RDF/XML serialization. At this stage, the response code is 200 and also con.getInstanceFollowRedirects() is true, so I assume that the API handles such cases automatically. Does anyone have working code for such cases?

"Invitation to contribute to DBpedia by improving the infobox mappings + New Scala-based Extraction Framework"	"uHi all, in order to extract high quality data from Wikipedia, the DBpedia extraction framework relies on infobox to ontology mappings which define how Wikipedia infobox templates are mapped to classes of the DBpedia ontology. Up to now, these mappings were defined only by the DBpedia team and as Wikipedia is huge and contains lots of different infobox templates, we were only able to define mappings for a small subset of all Wikipedia infoboxes and also only managed to map a subset of the properties of these infoboxes. In order to enable the DBpedia user community to contribute to improving the coverage and the quality of the mappings, we have set up a public wiki at which contains: 1. all mappings that are currently used by the DBpedia extraction framework 2. the definition of the DBpedia ontology and 3. documentation for the DBpedia mapping language as well as step-by-step guides on how to extend and refine mappings and the ontology. So if you are using DBpedia data and you you were always annoyed that DBpedia did not properly cover the infobox template that is most important to you, you are highly invited to extend the mappings and the ontology in the wiki. Your edits will be used for the next DBpedia release expected to be published in the first week of April. The process of contributing to the ontology and the mappings is as follows: 1. You familiarize yourself with the DBpedia mapping language by reading the documentation in the wiki. 2. In order to prevent random SPAM, the wiki is read-only and new editors need to be confirmed by a member of the DBpedia team (currently Anja Jentzsch does the clearing). Therefore, please create an account in the wiki for yourself. After this, Anja will give you editing rights and you can edit the mappings as well as the ontology. 3. For contributing to the next DBpedia relase, you can edit until Sunday, March 21. After this, we will check the mappings and the ontology definition in the Wiki for consistency and then use both for the next DBpedia release. So, we are starting kind of a social experiment on if the DBpedia user community is willing to contribute to the improvement of DBpedia and on how the DBpedia ontology develops through community contributions :-) Please excuse, that it is currently still rather cumbersome to edit the mappings and the ontology. We are currently working on a visual editor for the mappings as well as a validation service, which will check edits to the mappings and test the new mappings against example pages from Wikipedia. We hope that we will be able to deploy these tools in the next two months, but still wanted to release the wiki as early as possible in order to already allow community contributions to the DBpedia 3.5 release. If you have questions about the wiki and the mapping language, please ask them on the DBpedia mailing list where Anja and Robert will answer them. What else is happening around DBpedia? In order to speed up the data extraction process and to lay a solid foundation for the DBpedia Live extraction, we have ported the DBpedia extraction framework from PHP to Scala/Java. The new framework extracts exactly the same types of data from Wikipedia as the old framework, but processes a single page now in 13 milliseconds instead of the 200 milliseconds. In addition, the new framework can extract data from tables within articles and can handle multiple infobox templates per article. The new framework is available under GPL license in the DBpedia SVN and is documented at The whole DBpedia team is very thankful to two companies which enabled us to do all this by sponsoring the DBpedia project: 1. Vulcan Inc. as part of its Project Halo (www.projecthalo.com). Vulcan Inc. creates and advances a variety of world-class endeavors and high impact initiatives that change and improve the way we live, learn, do business ( 2. Neofonie GmbH, a Berlin-based company offering leading technologies in the area of Web search, social media and mobile applications ( Thank you a lot for your support! I personally would also like to thank: 1. Anja Jentzsch, Robert Isele, and Christopher Sahnwaldt for all their great work on implementing the new extraction framework and for setting up the mapping wiki. 2. Andreas Lange and Sidney Bofah for correcting and extending the mappings in the Wiki. Cheers, Chris uOn Freitag, 12.

Some interesting stuff seems to be going on here, and I'd like to see it better documented For a long time there's been the problem that some named entities have their own DBpedia resource and others don't because of the accidental nature of how things work on Wikipedia. Here's an example of two fictional characters that play an isomorphic role in two very similar works: The perfect \"generic database\" would treat these two entities in the same way And it looks like dbpedia is starting to address this. has two engines listed in the Infobox, and it appears the extractor is parsing the \"name\" of the engine to extract some nice facts: On the other hand, this one looks like doesn't have such clear value It seems to be identifying a \"facet\" of the boat, that is, its career as a part of the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The value of this isn't so clear to me, but perhaps there is some sense to it. The oddly named dbpedia-owl:added field applies to this career, so maybe this makes sense. The two PersonFunctions up there look specious, particularly because I don't see dbpedia-owl:Writer dbpedia-owl:Actor dbpedia-owl:Comedian dbpedia-owl:MusicalArtist anywhere near the Person or PersonFunction instances. That said, I do see some places where \"PersonFunction\" has promising roles to play: the functionEndData and functionEndYear properties are obviously useful. There's an issue of how these new \"synthetic\" identifiers (that don't correspond 1-1 to wikipedia pages) map to external resources. \"PersonFunction\" is similar (but probably not equivalent) to the \"Employment Tenure\" CVC in Freebase. Certainly some of these new synthetic identifiers correspond to resources in Freebase as well, since Freebase sometimes splits wikipedia topics into multiple entities. Note also looking at I see a lot of properties that just don't make any sense at all, such a \"wavelength\", \"sourceConfluenceMountain\", \"shipDraft\". I don't know if this some artifact of how the whole system works (looks like these properties all have a domain of \"owl:Thing\") but it does shock my sensibilities.

"Odp: Odp: probably incorrect mapping to schema.org from MusicalArtist"	"uHi Aldo, thanks for the references - I will definitely look into them. I know about the systematic polysemy phenomenon - e.g. sentences where you use two meanings of one polysemous word are semantically valid. But I am not saying that you have to make a commitment to one classification of a certain \"object\" that is described in Wikipedia, e.g. church as a building vs church as a community. What I am saying is that when you use DBpedia ontology, where the classes are vaguely defined you are indeed making some commitments (as Peter pointed out) by interpreting churches as a buildings, while in Cyc there are such distinctions, but there are also relations that keep these interpretations together. What I am mostly concerned with is the process of developing DBpedia ontology. I have pointed out inconsistencies in Wikipedia which are a by-product of its community based development. Having 5 or 6 means of expressing one information (e.g. administrative categories) is not a problem of polysemy, but is a problem of a community driven process. Assuming DBpedia ontology creators will agree that a church is a systematically polysemous concept I don't expect that all systematically polysemous concepts will be treated as such. My belief is based on my careful examination of Wikipedia (incoherent) structure and the problems discovered in the DBpedia ontology that were discussed so far. But you may be right in yet another sense - there is no much semantics in SemanticWeb. At least - if you look at DBpedia from God's perspective you are making a mistake. There are only portions of the data that are useful in certain applications and you have to adjust them to your \"ontology\" before you start using it. Kind regards, Aleksander"
"dump problems"	"uHi, i'm currently struggling with the DBpedia 3.7 dumps, but as the DBpedia 3.8 seems to be on the road i thought i'd let you know about some of the problems i encountered by now which make it tricky to work with the dumps. I downloaded the 3.7 all_languages.tar and the all_languages-i18n.tar and the interlang-i18n.tar . The problems i encountered are mainly related to the i18n dataset, but can also be found in the interlanguage links of the \"traditional\" dump (in the all_languages.tar): It seems as if the de, el and ru wikipedia were exported in a different way from other languages, as their encodings are different and they have the language prefix in the URIs (de.dbpedia.org). They use UTF-8 IRIs in the dump files, while all other languages i tried use % escaped URIs and don't have a language prefixed URI. This leads to a couple of encoding issues (.nt files are ASCII only and normally use % encoding, but de, el and ru contain UTF-8 here) and inconsistencies (e.g., interlanguage links to fr.dbpedia.org pointing into nothing). Also the interlanguage link files show different ways of encoding within the same file, making them tricky to load. Details where you can see these issue: (the following is all related to the 3.7-i18n dumps!) File Encoding: Mainly the de, el and ru, as well as the interlanguage_link dumps contain .nt files with UTF-8 encoding (for IRIs). This isn't valid .nt, so maybe consider renaming all those files to .n3? Example: from de/labels_de.nt.bz2: \"Anschlussf\u00E4higkeit\"@de . from fr/lables_fr.nt.bz2: \"Alg\u00E8bre g\u00E9n\u00E9rale\"@fr . Encoding & escaping: The de, el and ru IRIs seem to be UTF-8 encoded and () seem to be \"unescaped\". All other languages I tried seem to use % encoded URIs and escape the brackets with %28 / %29. Example: from interlang-i18n/el/interlanguage_links_el.nt.bz2 . . . . . Inter language links: en and de just link to each other and el. ( minor: interlanguage_links_en.n3.bz2 seems to have 3082 triples of this form: ?s owl:sameAs ?s ) All other languages seem to have owl:sameAs to all languages. Prefixing dbpedia.org with language codes: de, el and ru files contain URIs like de.dbpedia.org, el.dbpedia.org, ru.dbpedia.org. fr, es, nl, (all others i tried) lack the prefixes in all data files i tried, but the interlanguage_links_en.n3 show them. This leads to all interlanguage links pointing to Example: from fr/lables_fr.nt.bz2: \"Alg\u00E8bre g\u00E9n\u00E9rale\"@fr . from interlang-i18n/fr/interlanguage_links_fr.nt.bz2: . . I'd happily offer a hand to help fixing these issues in 3.8. Cheers, JÃ¶rn PS: yes, i just wanted to update uHi JÃ¶rn, most of these problems should be fixed in the current development version of the code. 1. Text encoding Starting with 3.8, we will be able to generate all kinds of different file formats, mainly N-Triples, N-Quads and Turtle, but also TriX. The N-Triples and N-Quads files will be ASCII only, as required by the spec. Of course, that means they are hardly human-readable for non-Latin languages. The Turtle files use no special Turtle features like @prefix, they are basically N-Triples files that use UTF-8 encoding. They are human human-readable for all languages, because only some special ASCII characters have to be escaped in Turtle. We also produce turtle-quads files. I don't think there is a formal specification for that format - it's basically N-Quads, but with Turtle rules for \u escaping, i.e. using UTF-8 instead of most \u escapes. If you still find any encoding problems, please let us know. The Turtle rules may not be implemented correctly for higher Unicode planes. 2. URI escaping Also starting with 3.8, there will be a very simple configuration switch to chose between IRIs (only a few special ASCII chars are percent-escaped) and URIs (special ASCII chars and all non-ASCII chars are percent-escaped). Both can be written to different files during one extraction run. We will probably have to chose 'canonical' DBpedia URIs/IRIs though, so we may not publish both versions. In both cases, round brackets \"()\" will not be escaped because the RFCs for URIs and IRIs do not mandate it. I hope this won't cause too many backwards-compatibility problems. If it does, it's trivial to change this behavior since I we now have our own configurable URI encoder. Again, the problems should be fixed, but especially for higher Unicode planes, IRI escaping may not be quite correct. We're not sure yet which of these files we will publish. There are twelve different format combinations (quads/triples, URIs/IRIs, NT/Turtle, etc), and it doesn't make sense to publish them all. In the past, we only published NT and NQ files, but I would like to also offer Turtle. 3. Inter language links and 4. DBpedia language domains are fodder for a separate mail So much for now, Christopher On Mon, May 7, 2012 at 12:19 PM, JÃ¶rn Hees < > wrote:"

That's invalid Turtle, QNames are not allowed to include %-encoded characters. This means Sindice staff has to manually exclude this dump when indexing DBpedia.

I want to retrieve the genres of all musical artists. The following query PREFIX rdf: PREFIX dbpedia: SELECT ?Artist ?Genre WHERE { ?Artist rdf:type dbpedia:MusicalArtist; dbpedia:genre ?Genre . } returns too many results hence I used OFFSET and LIMIT to split them into manageable subsets. To have predictable sets of results I used ORDER BY on Artist. In the following query I was expecting to see the genres of Billie Holiday ( the listing, but they are missing. PREFIX rdf: PREFIX dbpedia: SELECT ?Artist ?Genre WHERE { ?Artist rdf:type dbpedia:MusicalArtist; dbpedia:genre ?Genre . } ORDER BY ?Artist OFFSET 4425 LIMIT 1000 If I increase the limit it should return more solutions per query but overall it should return the same solutions. With a limit of 5000 the genres of Billie Holiday show up but at a higher offset that I would expect PREFIX rdf: PREFIX dbpedia: SELECT ?Artist ?Genre WHERE { ?Artist rdf:type dbpedia:MusicalArtist; dbpedia:genre ?Genre . } ORDER BY ?Artist OFFSET 5725 LIMIT 2000 Somehow the size of LIMIT seams to be influencing the outcome of these queries.

"what areas of knowledge has the best qualityand coverage in dbpedia?"	"uI'd say that things are represented well in Dbpedia when the things are objects that have well defined properties. For instance, if I show up at the courthouse with a birth certificate that documents my date and place of birth and my parents, that proves that I'm a particular Person. Someday I'll have a death certificate with a date, place and cause of death and in between there may be records about jobs I held, things I wrote, performances I was in and so forth. People who make their mark with creative activities, for instance, I think DBpedia well represents the creative output of somebody like On the other hand if somebody is a cop/bureaucrat it is harder to document their career. For instance, it wouldn't be so clear that his influence was orders of magnitude greater than any of these people I suppose you could add properties for \"?s arrested ?o .\" and \"?s did surveillance on ?o .\" and \"?s intimidated ?o .\" but that is not there now. You can also do a good job with chemicals, automobiles, airplane models and things like that. On the other hand, consider topics like Even though these are all activities that people do, they don't have common properties in infoboxes. I guess they could, because people spend a certain amount of money on these things a year, a certain number of people are interested, all three of them are things people can do as a hobby but you can't (by law) make money doing amateur radio (unless you're a teacher helping a class talk to astronauts on the ISS or that you can occasionally sell used gear on a swap net.) uOk, this far I understand. The topics that have infoboxes will be represented better in DBpedia, that's clear. I have a different question: which topics with infoboxes are represented better than other topics with infoboxes? Is there a rating or leaderboard of the topics? uHi Yury, this page [1] will show you which is the current status of the en template mappings. There are stats about the percentage of mapped properties. Hope this helps. Cheers Andrea [1] 2013/10/1 Yury Katkov < > uCool, thanks!"
"DBpedia Class Hierarchy"	"uHi Tom, btw, we have agree on a naming schema for the DBpedia classes. It's important to have URIs that deal with ambiguity. The Yago approach is to use only one meaning (Wordnet's most frequent), but if we try to build a class hierarchy we need a URI for each meaning. IMO there are to different approaches: 1. use Wordnet IDs 2. use Wikipedia URIs So to diffentiate the meaning of \"bank\" for example, using Wordnet: - \"bank_108420278\" for the financial institution - \"bank_109213565\" for sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water) using Wikipedia (see - \"Bank\" for the financial institution - \"Bank_(XYZ)\" for other meanings The Wikipedia approach is much more intuitive, but Wordnet is already represented in RDFS, which will be a hard task to do with Wikipedia names. Cheers, Georgi uHi All, We need to retain the benefits of WordNet synsets, focus on data conversions to RDF, and use what already exists. The advantage of the SKOS prefLable and altLabel is that, in the end, in really doesn't matter. Your \"glad\" may be my \"happy\" so why fight about it? We just need to adopt a standard reference and use it. So, we use WordNet for prefLabel, have a mapping mechanism via altLabel and WordNet synsets, let's move on. We have to adopt a canonical reference somewhere, and unfortunately, Wikipedia has no such synsets. Using WordNet synsets, we can still have as much richness as anyone could desire, even if a particular term may not be someone's favorite. I suspect the fastest way to stall out the Linked Data initiative is to get sucked into the endless vortex of terminology and epistemology arguments. Mike Georgi Kobilarov wrote: uGeorgi Kobilarov wrote: For books, there are ISBN which are far from perfect(*), but still a lot more precise than just the title of a book. Wikipedia has articles for some books, and the book title is used as the URL and article title. But the ISBN is found inside the article and can be dug out from the public database dumps. Germany's national library assigns a unique ID number to each author, known as the PND (personennamendatei = authority file). The German Wikipedia has articles about many authors and their names are the URL and article title. But the PNDs are found inside the article text, So, identifiers can be tied to Wikipedia articles even if they aren't used as article titles. In a similar fashion, it is technically possible to embed the Wordnet identifiers inside the text of Wikipedia (and Wiktionary) articles. Whether that is a good idea that will get accepted by the community, depends on how useful an application you can design from this. (*) Old books don't have ISBNs. One book may have several ISBNs, one for each edition. The list of limitations goes on and on."

"Odd foaf:name values"	"uI have noticed that the files \"Mappingbased literals\" provided for download here contain rather odd values, and rather a lot of those. For example for English there are the following entries for Hitchcock: < where \"(KBE\" as a name looks odd to me. or < where both the name in parentheses and the \"(DBE)\" looks odd to me. Other literals contain several entries or additional descriptive text, e.g. \"Laqab: Diya ad-Din (shortly), Adud ad-Dawlah\"@en . \"Kunya: Abu Shuja\"@en . \"Given name: Muhammad\"@en . \"Turkic nickname: Alp Arslan\"@en . \"Nasab: Alp ArslanibnChaghri-Beg ibnMikailibnSeljuqibnDuqaq\"@en . Sometimes the language id for the literal appears to be incorrect, e.g. \"Athens\"@en . \"ÎÎ¸Î®Î½Î±\"@en . In the German language file, some entries are still worse, e.g.: \"Akeleien\"@de . \"HahnenfuÃgewÃ¤chse\"@de . \"HahnenfuÃartige\"@de . \"Eudikotyledonen\"@de . \"Gattung\"@de . \"Tribus\"@de . \"Unterfamilie\"@de . \"Familie\"@de . \"Ordnung\"@de . \"ohne\"@de . \"nein\"@de . \"L.\"@de . Clearly, only the first of these triples is correct. The template for this entry is not filled incorrectly or otherwise broken though: {{Taxobox | Taxon_Name = Akeleien | Taxon_WissName = Aquilegia | Taxon_Rang = Gattung | Taxon_Autor = [[Carl von LinnÃ©|L.]] | Taxon2_LinkName = nein | Taxon2_WissName = Isopyreae | Taxon2_Rang = Tribus | Taxon3_WissName = Isopyroideae | Taxon3_Rang = Unterfamilie | Taxon4_Name = HahnenfuÃgewÃ¤chse | Taxon4_WissName = Ranunculaceae | Taxon4_Rang = Familie | Taxon5_Name = HahnenfuÃartige | Taxon5_WissName = Ranunculales | Taxon5_Rang = Ordnung | Taxon6_Name = Eudikotyledonen | Taxon6_Rang = ohne | Bild = Aquilegia ottonis amaliae2UME.jpg | Bildbeschreibung = [[Balkanische Akelei]] (''[[Aquilegia ottonis]]'' subsp. ''amaliae'') }} I do not know too much about how the triples get extracted from the original Wikimedia text or templates, but it seems that the extraction is too lenient instead of too strict: personally I would rather have no entries for those wrong ones. Although the semantics of foaf:name are pretty loose, I do not think that for organisms, all the higher level taxon names should be seen as the name of that organism, clearly \"Eukaryote\" is not a name of humans even though humans belong to this group. That the names of the taxon group is also included (e.g. the value for Taxon4_Rang) appears to be a bug. These are all examples only, but there are many more entries where the same errors appear in a systematic way. Is there any way to accomplish an extraction of the triples with more importance of precision than recall? I have noticed that the files 'Mappingbased literals' provided for download here Â Â recall?Â uIn the case of the first two, (KBE) and (DBE) are abbreviations of chivalric titles which aren't that different from putting PhD or MD after the name, just I think it's more exclusive. You could make the case that \"Sir Alfred Hitchcock (KBE)\" is a valid name, but KBE itself is not. \"Lady Mallowan\" is a totally appropriate name for Agatha Christie because she was married to Max Mallowan who was himself a knight before she became a Dame. In general when you are harvesting names like this there is the problem of finding the valid variant forms and not finding invalid forms. There is also the issue that you should be more liberal about what you recognize than what you generate. For instance you can find some racist slurs in Wikipedia redirects which are names you probably should recognize if somebody tries to use them but that will probably cause you trouble if you try to use them. uHi Johann, I just had a closer look at the German example. In this case the foaf:name property is used very liberally as a mapping: {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon_Name | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon2_Name | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon3_Name | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon4_Name | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon5_Name | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon6_Name | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Bild | ontologyProperty = foaf:depiction }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Bildbeschreibung | ontologyProperty = depictionDescription }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon_WissName | ontologyProperty = scientificName }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon2_WissName | ontologyProperty = scientificName }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon3_WissName | ontologyProperty = scientificName }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon4_WissName | ontologyProperty = scientificName }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon5_WissName | ontologyProperty = scientificName }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon6_WissName | ontologyProperty = scientificName }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon_Rang | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon2_Rang | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon3_Rang | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon4_Rang | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon5_Rang | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon6_Rang | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon2_LinkName | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon3_LinkName | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon4_LinkName | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon5_LinkName | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon6_LinkName | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon_Autor | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon2_Autor | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon3_Autor | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon4_Autor | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Taxon5_Autor | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Modus | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = ErdzeitalterVon | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Fundorte | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = MioVon | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = MioBis | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Subtaxa | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Subtaxa_Rang | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = ErdzeitalterBis | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Subtaxa_Plural | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = RangunterdrÃ¼ckung | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = TausendBis | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = TausendVon | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} {{PropertyMapping | templateProperty = Name | ontologyProperty = foaf:name }} This causes this behavior, obviously. Please feel free to change this mapping to a more precise depiction of Taxobox template in DBpedia.

Have you checked the console log? Also, have you tried dumping the response, i.e. the JSON object (if any) to the console (e.g. console.log(data))?

"DBpedia Quality Improvement: Please reportbugs!"	"uHi Tom, Thanks for your message. Your example the Wikipedia-URI of Trust_(social_sciences) was Trust_(sociology) in February when we picked up the Wikipedia dump. We do need (but don't have yet) a mechanism to construct redirects in DBpedia for such changes, so links to DBpedia URIs will not end as dead links. We will most likely switch to unencoded URIs with our next release because Apache does funny things (well, not funny if you try to debug it, Richard) with encoded URIs. So You find it selecting \"virtue\" or \"issue\" from the cloud. Well, maybe some work to do on classification?! ;) The current version of DBpedia Search uses incoming links as one metric to compute the rank of results. The next version will use a PageRank variant, where the rank of linking articles is also included. These lists of articles (for example List of National Trust properties in England ) get high ranks this way, I don't know for sure how to handle it yet. Next version will also solve this annoying performance;) :) Cheers, Georgi uHi Tom, so, I discussed that with Richard and we will stay with encoded URIs, because Wikipedia use encoded links in it's HTML. For example, see links in HTML of Our reason to consider switching to unencoded URIs was that bug with the Apache Proxy, but that's fixed.

Please clear my mind :) Thank you in advice, Piero Hello everyone, i'm working on a project tat involves the use of the classes of dbpedia ontology and YAGO. Analizyng some resources there are examples that doesn't match to me, so I'm asking for a bit of explanation about them. Exmple 1: Piero uPiero, Short answer: Ignore dbprop:type and dbpedia-owl:type, use only rdf:type. Long answer: dbprop:type and dbpedia-owl:type are generated from Wikipedia template properties with similar names and are sometimes confusing. rdf:type properties are more precise - they are only generated if the Wikipedia page uses a template for which we have a mapping to our ontology. Concerning your examples: for which we have a mapping to our ontology, so we generate an rdf:type property with the value dbpedia-owl:PopulatedPlace and its base types. The wiki source code of contains the following template, which has a 'type' property: {{Infobox Pirate | type = [[Pirate]] }} We don't have a mapping from to our ontology (yet), so we generate no rdf:type and no dbpedia-owl:* properties, only generic dbprop:* properties, which are simply the template properties with minor improvements - in this case, we convert the Wiki link [[Pirate]] to the URI dbpedia:Pirate. Your next example is interesting - its Wiki source code contains the the following: {{Infobox Company | company_type = Anti-[[pirate|piracy]] [[private security]] }} We do have a mapping from to our ontology, so we generate the appropriate rdf:type property. The mapping also defines that the template property 'company_type' is mapped to the RDF property dbpedia-owl:type. The value for that property is extracted from the template property value, which contains a Wiki link to [[pirate]], which is (as before) converted to the URI dbpedia:Pirate. Maybe the parser shoudn't discard the prefix 'Anti'. :-) I hope that clears things up a bit Christopher On Tue, Sep 29, 2009 at 16:08, Piero Molino < > wrote: uPiero, Currently about one million resources have an rdf:type and dbpedia-owl:* properties.

"DBpedia to schema.org"	"uHey all, the DBpedia ontology now provides mappings to schema.org vocabulary. There are 44 equivalent classes, 10 sub classes and 31 equivalent properties. This mappings can be edited via the mappings wiki. Because of the different detail level of schema.org and DBpedia ontology we only cover 54 of about 290 schema.org classes. For instance, schema.org has round about 120 classes for local businesses ( e.g. BikeStore, BookStore, ClothingStore, ComputerStore, Attorney, Dentist, Electrician, HousePainter, Locksmith, ). The DBpedia ontology doesn't provide such detailed classes, because Wikipedia hasn't articles for small local stores or services. I have attached lists of the mappings to this email. You are invited to discuss or edit the mappings. How to map schema.org classes/properties: The owl:equivalentClass property now contains a comma seperated list of equivalent classes. dbpedia-owl:Person for example: {{Class | rdfs: = person | owl:equivalentClass = foaf:Person, schema:Person }} Sub classes are defined by the rdfs:subClassOf property. Here, it is to consider that the order of given classes is important for the dbpedia ontology hierarchy. If a class is a sub class of another dbpedia class, the dbpedia class must be given first. dbpedia-owl:MusicFestival for example: {{Class | rdfs: = music festival | rdfs:subClassOf = Event, schema:Festival }} Equivalent properties are of course defined by owl:equivalentProperty. dbpedia-owl:foundedBy for example: {{ObjectProperty | rdfs: = founded by | rdfs:domain = owl:Thing | rdfs:range = owl:Thing | owl:equivalentProperty = schema:founders }} regards, Paul dbpedia-owl:Aircraft -> schema:Product dbpedia-owl:Automobile -> schema:Product dbpedia-owl:Band -> schema:MusicGroup dbpedia-owl:FilmFestival -> schema:Festival dbpedia-owl:Instrument -> schema:Product dbpedia-owl:Locomotive -> schema:Product dbpedia-owl:MusicalArtist -> schema:MusicGroup dbpedia-owl:MusicFestival -> schema:Festival dbpedia-owl:Ship -> schema:Product dbpedia-owl:Weapon -> schema:Product dbpedia-owl:Work = schema:CreativeWork dbpedia-owl:Website = schema:WebPage dbpedia-owl:University = schema:CollegeOrUniversity dbpedia-owl:TelevisionStation = schema:TelevisionStation dbpedia-owl:TelevisionEpisode = schema:TVEpisode dbpedia-owl:Stadium = schema:StadiumOrArena dbpedia-owl:SportsTeam = schema:SportsTeam dbpedia-owl:SportsEvent = schema:SportsEvent dbpedia-owl:Song = schema:MusicRecording dbpedia-owl:SkiArea = schema:SkiResort dbpedia-owl:Sculpture = schema:Sculpture dbpedia-owl:Restaurant = schema:Restaurant dbpedia-owl:River = schema:RiverBodyOfWater dbpedia-owl:School = schema:School dbpedia-owl:ShoppingMall = schema:ShoppingCenter dbpedia-owl:RadioStation = schema:RadioStation dbpedia-owl:Place = schema:Place dbpedia-owl:Library = schema:Library dbpedia-owl:Museum = schema:Museum dbpedia-owl:Painting = schema:Painting dbpedia-owl:Person = schema:Person dbpedia-owl:Park = schema:Park dbpedia-owl:Organisation = schema:Organization dbpedia-owl:Mountain = schema:Mountain dbpedia-owl:GovernmentAgency = schema:GovernmentOrganization dbpedia-owl:Language = schema:Language dbpedia-owl:Lake = schema:LakeBodyOfWater dbpedia-owl:Hotel = schema:Hotel dbpedia-owl:Hospital = schema:Hospital dbpedia-owl:HistoricPlace = schema:LandmarksOrHistoricalBuildings dbpedia-owl:HistoricBuilding = schema:LandmarksOrHistoricalBuildings dbpedia-owl:Film = schema:Movie dbpedia-owl:Event = schema:Event dbpedia-owl:EducationalInstitution = schema:EducationalOrganization dbpedia-owl:Country = schema:Country dbpedia-owl:Continent = schema:Continent dbpedia-owl:College = schema:CollegeOrUniversity dbpedia-owl:City = schema:City dbpedia-owl:Canal = schema:Canal dbpedia-owl:Book = schema:Book dbpedia-owl:BodyOfWater = schema:BodyOfWater dbpedia-owl:Arena = schema:StadiumOrArena dbpedia-owl:Album = schema:MusicAlbum dbpedia-owl:Airport = schema:Airport dbpedia-owl:startDate = schema:startDate dbpedia-owl:starring = schema:actors dbpedia-owl:spouse = schema:spouse dbpedia-owl:runtime = schema:duration dbpedia-owl:relative = schema:relatedTo dbpedia-owl:publisher = schema:publisher dbpedia-owl:producer = schema:producer dbpedia-owl:picture = schema:image dbpedia-owl:parentOrganisation = schema:branchOf dbpedia-owl:numberOfPages = schema:numberOfPages dbpedia-owl:numberOfEpisodes = schema:numberOfEpisodes dbpedia-owl:nationality = schema:nationality dbpedia-owl:musicComposer = schema:musicBy dbpedia-owl:map = schema:maps dbpedia-owl:mediaType = schema:bookFormat dbpedia-owl:location = schema:location dbpedia-owl:locatedInArea = schema:containedIn dbpedia-owl:language = schema:inLanguage dbpedia-owl:isbn = schema:isbn dbpedia-owl:illustrator = schema:illustrator dbpedia-owl:genre = schema:genre dbpedia-owl:foundedBy = schema:founders dbpedia-owl:episodeNumber = schema:episodeNumber dbpedia-owl:endDate = schema:endDate dbpedia-owl:director = schema:director dbpedia-owl:deathDate = schema:deathDate dbpedia-owl:child = schema:children dbpedia-owl:birthDate = schema:birthDate dbpedia-owl:award = schema:awards dbpedia-owl:author = schema:author dbpedia-owl:artist = schema:byArtist uPaul, Awesome!

"DBpedia 3.8 released, including enlarged Ontology and additional localized Versions"	"uHi all, we are happy to announce the release of DBpedia 3.8. The most important improvements of the new release compared to DBpedia 3.7 are: 1. the DBpedia 3.8 release is based on updated Wikipedia dumps dating from late May/early June 2012. 2. the DBpedia ontology is enlarged and the number of infobox to ontology mappings has risen. 3. the DBpedia internationalization has progressed and we now provide localized versions of DBpedia in even more languages. The English version of the DBpedia 3.8 knowledge base describes 3.77 million things, out of which 2.35 million are classified in a consistent Ontology, including 764,000 persons, 573,000 places (including 387,000 populated places), 333,000 creative works (including 112,000 music albums, 72,000 films and 18,000 video games), 192,000 organizations (including 45,000 companies and 42,000 educational institutions), 202,000 species and 5,500 diseases. We provide localized versions of DBpedia in 111 languages. All these versions together describe 20.8 million things, out of which 10.5 mio overlap (are interlinked) with concepts from the English DBpedia. The full DBpedia data set features labels and abstracts for 10.3 million unique things in 111 different languages; 8.0 million links to images and 24.4 million HTML links to external web pages; 27.2 million data links into external RDF data sets, 55.8 million links to Wikipedia categories, and 8.2 million YAGO categories. The dataset consists of 1.89 billion pieces of information (RDF triples) out of which 400 million were extracted from the English edition of Wikipedia, 1.46 billion were extracted from other language editions, and about 27 million are data links into external RDF data sets. The main changes between DBpedia 3.7 and 3.8 are described below: 1. Enlarged Ontology The DBpedia community added many new classes and properties on the mappings wiki. The DBpedia 3.8 ontology encompasses  359 classes (DBpedia 3.7: 319)  800 object properties (DBpedia 3.7: 750)  859 datatype properties (DBpedia 3.7: 791)  116 specialized datatype properties (DBpedia 3.7: 102)  45 owl:equivalentClass and 31 owl:equivalentProperty mappings to 2. Additional Infobox to Ontology Mappings The editors of the mappings wiki also defined many new mappings from Wikipedia templates to DBpedia classes. For the DBpedia 3.8 extraction, we used 2347 mappings, among them  Polish: 382 mappings  English: 345 mappings  German: 211 mappings  Portuguese: 207 mappings  Greek: 180 mappings  Slovenian: 170 mappings  Korean: 146 mappings  Hungarian: 111 mappings  Spanish: 107 mappings  Turkish: 91 mappings  Czech: 66 mappings  Bulgarian: 61 mappings  Catalan: 52 mappings  Arabic: 51 mappings 3. New local DBpedia Chapters We are also happy to see the number of local DBpedia chapters in different countries rising. Since the 3.7 DBpedia release we welcomed the French, Italian and Japanese Chapters. In addition, we expect the Dutch DBpedia chapter to go online during the next months (in cooperation with and dereferencable URIs for the DBpedia data in their corresponding language. The DBpedia Internationalization page provides an overview of the current state of the DBpedia Internationalization effort. 4. New and updated RDF Links into External Data Sources We have added new RDF links pointing at resources in the following Linked Data sources: Amsterdam Museum, BBC Wildlife Finder, CORDIS, DBTune, Eurostat (Linked Statistics), GADM, LinkedGeoData, OpenEI (Open Energy Info). In addition, we have updated many of the existing RDF links pointing at other Linked Data sources. 5. New Wiktionary2RDF Extractor We developed a DBpedia extractor, that is configurable for any Wiktionary edition. It generates an comprehensive ontology about languages for use as a semantic lexical resource in linguistics. The data currently includes language, part of speech, senses with definitions, synonyms, taxonomies (hyponyms, hyperonyms, synonyms, antonyms) and translations for each lexical word. It furthermore is hosted as Linked Data and can serve as a central linking hub for LOD in linguistics. Currently available languages are English, German, French, Russian. In the next weeks we plan to add Vietnamese and Arabic. The goal is to allow the addition of languages just by configuration without the need of programming skills, enabling collaboration as in the Mappings Wiki. For more information visit 6. Improvements to the Data Extraction Framework  Additionally to N-Triples and N-Quads, the framework was extended to write triple files in Turtle format  Extraction steps that looked for links between different Wikipedia editions were replaced by more powerful post-processing scripts  Preparation time and effort for abstract extraction is minimized, extraction time is reduced to a few milliseconds per page  To save file system space, the framework can compress DBpedia triple files while writing and decompress Wikipedia XML dump files while reading  Using some bit twiddling, we can now load all ~200 million inter-language links into a few GB of RAM and analyze them  Users can download ontology and mappings from mappings wiki and store them in files to avoid downloading them for each extraction, which takes a lot of time and makes extraction results less reproducible  We now use IRIs for all languages except English, which uses URIs for backwards compatibility  We now resolve redirects in all datasets where the objects URIs are DBpedia resources  We check that extracted dates are valid (e.g. February never has 30 days) and its format is valid according to its XML Schema type, e.g. xsd:gYearMonth  We improved the removal of HTML character references from the abstracts  When extracting raw infobox properties, we make sure that predicate URI can be used in RDF/XML by appending an underscore if necessary  Page IDs and Revision IDs datasets now use the DBpedia resource as subject URI, not the Wikipedia page URL  We use foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf instead of foaf:page for the link from DBpedia resource to Wikipedia page  New inter-language link datasets for all languages Accessing the DBpedia 3.8 Release You can download the new DBpedia dataset from As usual, the dataset is also available as Linked Data and via the DBpedia SPARQL endpoint at Credits Lots of thanks to  Jona Christopher Sahnwaldt (Freie Universität Berlin, Germany) for improving the DBpedia extraction framework and for extracting the DBpedia 3.8 data sets.  Dimitris Kontokostas (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece) for implementing the language generalizations to the extraction framework.  Uli Zellbeck and Anja Jentzsch (Freie Universität Berlin, Germany) for generating the new and updated RDF links to external datasets using the Silk interlinking framework.  Jonas Brekle (Universität Leipzig, Germany) and Sebastian Hellmann (Universität Leipzig, Germany) for their work on the new Wikionary2RDF extractor.  All editors that contributed to the DBpedia ontology mappings via the Mappings Wiki.  The whole Internationalization Committee for pushing the DBpedia internationalization forward.  Kingsley Idehen and Patrick van Kleef (both OpenLink Software) for loading the dataset into the Virtuoso instance that serves the Linked Data view and SPARQL endpoint.

"type of Bachelor_of_Arts"	"uHi Valentina, (and CCing the DBpedia discussion list) this is an effect of the heuristic typing we employ in DBpedia [1]. It works correctly in many cases, and sometimes it fails - as for these examples (the classic tradeoff between coverage and precision). To briefly explain how the error comes into existence: we look at the distribution of types that occur for the ingoing properties of an untyped instance. For dbpedia:Bachelor_of_Arts, there are, among others, 208 ingoing properties with the predicate dbpedia-owl:almaMater (which is already questionable). For that predicate, 87.6% of the objects are of type dbpedia-owl:University. So we have a strong pattern, with many supporting statements, and we conclude that dbpedia:Bachelor_of_Arts is a university. That mechanism, as I said, works reasonable well, but sometimes fails at single instances, like this one. For dbpedia:Academic_degree, you'll find similar questionable statements involving that instace, that mislead the heuristic typing algorithm. With the 2014 release, we further tried to reduce errors like these by filtering common nouns using WordNet before assigning types to instances, but both \"Academic degree\" and \"Bachelor of Arts\" escaped our nets here :-( The public DBpedia endpoint loads both the infobox based types and the heuristic types. If you need a \"clean\" version, I advise you to set up a local endpoint and load only the infobox based types into it. Best, Heiko [1] Am 13.10.2014 02:42, schrieb Valentina Presutti: uHi Valentina, I am not sure whether I understand you correctly. There might be cases of metonymy in DBpedia, but as far as I can see, Wikipedia is usually quite good at separating them via disambiguation pages, I am not sure whether there are too many example. The problem with the degrees, as far as I can tell, is not a metonymy one (degrees are just degrees, I have never seen them used to refer to a university), but simply a series of shortcomings in DBpedia. What happens here inside DBpedia is the following: * First, we find an infobox which says that someone's almaMater is, say, \"Princeton University (B.A.)\". Both Princeton and B.A. are linked to the respective Wikipedia pages. * The extraction framework extracts two statements from that: PersonX almaMater Princeton_University, and PersonX almaMater Bachelor_of_Arts (the second one being an error, which is very hard to avoid in the general case) * Since that happens a few times, we infer that Bachelor_of_Arts is a University. So in that case, I think it's purely a DBpedia problem. If you are aware of any actual cases of metonymy, however, I am curious to hear about that. All the best, Heiko Am 13.10.2014 16:33, schrieb Valentina Presutti: uHi guys, the problem of DBpedia entity types is not a new one. I have discussed some of the problems in the paper [1]. In my opinion it is pretty hard to establish the correct type of an entity using only one source of information. DBpedia uses Infoboxes (both infobox types and recently it performs type inference based on individual properties), YAGO uses categories while Tipalo uses first sentences. But each method has its inherent difficulties. In our recent research we try to combine these methods in order to provide most accurate typing of DBpedia entites. The intermediate results are available at [2]. Still they are not perfect, but we are making progress. E.g. we do not have \"Bachelor of Arts\", but we have: \"Bachelor of Arts in Applied Psychology\" and similar, which are classified as EducationalDegree. We use Cyc and Umbel concepts as types of the entities. If anyone is interested in that research, I am eager to discuss it during the forthcoming ISWC in Italy. Cheers, Aleksander [1] A.

[2] uI think the real problem here is that it is you can't make one database to satisfy everyone's requirements. For instance if you want to build a system to do reasoning about academic and professional credentials, this is easiest to build on top of an ontology (data structures) that is designed for the task and with data that is curated for the task. Like other databases, there is some serious overlap with DBpedia (enough that you could populate or enrich a credentials database from DBpedia), but you're always going to fight with the \"notability requirement\" in Wikipedia. Sooner or later there will be concept that is essential to your scheme that is not there. That's no reason not to hook up with DBpedia, but it is to recognize that is not going to please everybody and a big part of the value is of an exchange language uHi Valentina, We're also working on topics that involve relation extraction and had similar problems to yours. Together with colleagues from the Prague University of Economics we presented a solution approach at the last DBpedia Meeting in September, which should be rolling out in the next months. If you set up your own endpoint you can use the Linked Hypernyms Dataset [1], which is also available in English [2] . If you use the LHD 1 dataset you will get results like below. This is due to the fact that the necessary ontology classes don't exist yet in the main mappings wiki, but will probably find their way there soon. < [1] [2] Cheers, Alexandru On Tue, Oct 14, 2014 at 6:03 PM, Paul Houle < > wrote:"

When extracting data, the framework is looking for templates on Wikipedia pages having this name. If people use the redirect name in Wikipedia instead of the canonical name of the template (Info/MÃºsica/artista), it is possible to extract data using your mapping. This is why it works for these examples: But there is no Wikipedia page that uses the redirect name Info_Genero_musical. Every page about music genres in the Portuguese Wikipedia seems to use the canonical name Info/GÃªnero_musical. Therefore, the test mapping for Info_Genero_musical does not produces any output. We should definitely fix this. Creating mappings for the canonical name of infoboxes is the right thing to do, because then all infoboxes can be extracted: that ones that use the canonical name and the ones that use redirect names (they are resolved to the canonical name). I can propose another work-around until this is fixed. You can download the extraction framework [1] and start it in server mode. In the input box that will appear in your browser, you can enter the URI of the article you would like to extract. For example, I tested it for Rock_and_roll, Samba and House_music of the Portuguese Wikipedia, which all use the template Info/GÃªnero_musical. I know this is not as convenient as the test mappings, but maybe it is a possibility until we fixed the bug. Cheers, Max [1]"
"ORDER BY and utf8 (accents in portuguese names)"	"uHi! I'm new to the list and to the whole Linked Data thing altoghether, but will have to work on it for some time so I'll be exploring the DBpedia SPARQL end-point for a project we are working on. The thing is, it is based on Portuguese resources, and I was wondering first of all what is the general feeling on working with DBpedia on other-than-english resources. For example, (and this is my concrete question), is there a way to correctly order results so accented characters are also correctly ordered? If I try this example query on SELECT ?label WHERE { [] skos:subject ; rdfs:label ?label . FILTER ( langMatches(lang(?label), \"PT\") ) } ORDER BY ?label I get this results Notice that at the end Urbano Tavares Rodrigues Vasco Graça Moura Vitorino Nemésio Álvaro Cunhal \"Álvaro\" gets incorrectly ordered at the end. Is this dependent on the underlying store (much like SQL collations)?

""Attention data" in DBpedia?"	"uHi, I was wondering if the following data is available anywhere as part of DBpedia, or otherwise if there's any hope of getting it from DBpedia in the future. I think, but I'm not sure, that the raw data should be availabe in the Wikipedia database dumps. 1. View counts for Wikipedia pages. 2. Total number of edits for each Wikipedia page. 3. Inlink counts for Wikipedia pages. The first two are attention data. That's an interesting aspect of Wikipedia that isn't fully exploited yet. There are interesting applications where I could learn stuff about my own dataset by meshing it up with attention data from DBpedia. The third one is, in some way, also a measure of attention, and can be useful for ranking. (I'm thinking about stuff that can be done with the New York Times SKOS dataset, and using attention data from Wikipedia to gain insight into the NYT data might be quite interesting.) So, any hint about how to get the data above would be appreciated. Best, Richard uHi Richard, I'm pretty sure that the first two are not available in the Wikipedia dumps. For example, [1] lists pages-meta-current.xml.bz2 as \"All pages, current versions only.\" I don't think there is a dump of all pages. There once may have been one, but it probably became too big. For the view count, see [2]. But hey, I also found the following at [3]: \"Domas Mituzas put together a system to gather access statistics from wikipedia's squid cluster and publishes it here\" [4]. The inlink count can of course be extracted, either from the Wikipedia dump [5] or from DBpedia [6]. I wrote a bit of Java code that does exactly that because I needed it for the faceted browser [7], but didn't publish the results. I can send you the code if you want, though it's not really \"productized\". Cheers, Christopher [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] On Tue, Nov 10, 2009 at 23:26, Richard Cyganiak < > wrote: uSilly me.

That way, we could accurately link a DBPedia resource to the SIOC description of the corresponding Wikipedia page that has been used to extract this DBPedia information.

"questions about the extraction process"	"uHi everybody, I just came across DBPedia and it looks like a really awesome project. I noticed that the latest dump from the English Wikipedia is quite old (January 2008, Freebase does a new release every 3 months), so I am interested in creating a more up-to-date dbpedia from a recent download of the Wikipedia pages and articles (which I have). Is this possible? I am most interested in knowing which Wikipedia pages are people, companies, and possible disambiguations. Perhaps if there are URLs of the person (or company logo) on Wikipedia, that would be good too. I downloaded the SVN from sourceforge, but I'm afraid I am a little lost as I was unable to find any documentation. I have a suspicion that the entry point is the extraction/extract.php filebut I have no idea where to put the bz2 wikipedia dump file. Additionally, I noticed that the PersonData preview link is broken. This is disappointing as it is the one I am most interested in (so I had to download the full dataset). Is there any reason why this is only created from the German data? Shug uHello, Shug Boabby schrieb: Yes. You could use the YAGO hierarchy for this (which will be much improved in the next DBpedia release). Using subclass inferencing in Virtuoso, you can ask the DBpedia SPARQL endpoint for all individuals, which are instances of the class you are looking for, i.e. ask for instances of persons. (Note that there are resource limits on the server, so I believe it will only return 1000 results at a time. You need to ask several queries to get all persons.) You need to import all the dumps in a MySQL database. There is an import PHP script provided to do this. (Also see other threads in this list.) The extract.php file is the entry point for the complete extraction process. You may alter it to extract only what you are looking for. Some developer information about the framework can be found on documentation on creating your own DBpedia release. It is a very time-consuming process. I fixed it. There is no strict reason not to include it. I believe the extractor had problems on the English Wikipedia, which need to be fixed. It might be included in the next release. Kind regards, Jens uHello, At the time we started the project (December 2006), the German Wikipedia hold much more structured information in the Persondata template than the English Wikipedia. This might have changed in the meantime, so it's time to extract that data from the English Wikipedia as well. Cheers, Georgi"
"bug #1744807: Complex infobox values"	"uHello, The bug ( concerns unparsed values in the Wikipedia infobox dataset (by my count, it's in about 1.5% of the triples in infobox.nt). Has anybody discussed ideas for parsing this data? I understand the current effort is focused on pushing out the updated dataset, but I just thought I'd share my thoughts on this subject. In some cases, it is just marked-up text, but in others, it's data that would be useful to parse (e.g., dates like \"[[March 7]], [[322 BC]]\", \"[[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]], [[Massachusetts]]\" and date ranges). A simple yet reliable rule seems like it would be a challenge, but I have a few observations: 1. Dates and date ranges should be pretty easy to parse, although how would you store date ranges that have multiple values? Does it make sense to split such property into two triples (start and end)? 2. Look for property names that include the word\"date\" to try different mechanisms to parse dates from it. 3. In many cases, just parsing the first chunk of text is at least approximately correct (as a \"primary\" result). For example, getting \"Barbara Liskov\" out of: \"[[Barbara Liskov]] and her students at [[MIT]]\" . 4. Location-oriented properties are typically hierarchical (e.g., \"[[Corsica]], [[France]]\") I understand that some magic may still be involved in detecting and correctly parsing these cases, but I throw it out there anyway. In any case, I have some time to help get the new dataset out, let me know how I can assist. Rich uHi Rich, Piet has worked on unparsed values in the Wikipedia infobox dataset and I think he did a great job on improving the extraction code for them. He will be back in Berlin tomorrow and will check wheter he has allready implemented your ideas or if they are still missing from the code. Cheers Chris uRich Knopman wrote: I honestly don't think it makes much sense to spend time to find a solution for that in DBpedia. I rather think the problem should be tackled in Wikipedia itself. I think a fundamental paradigm of DBpedia should be not to change or alter any meaning of information extracted from Wikipedia. Exactly this would happen, if we omit stuff between list items in literals containing lists or enumerations. Also, how do you envision \"[[Barbara Liskov]] and her students at [[MIT]]\" to be represented? I think parsing here does not make sense, some people will want to have the literal rendered as HTML, some as pure text. If you want to ask, where \"Barbara Liskov\" is involved, you can also make a fultext-search on the literal data. On the Wikipedia side however, it will be easy to find cleaner and more meaningful representations (e.g. using sub-templates) and I think DBpedia should not aim for a quick hack but rather for longterm solutions. Anyway, Rich thanks a lot for sharing your ideas and I hope you find ways to contribute further to DBpedia. uSören, I agree with your thoughts. Fixing things at the source improves consistency and simplifies extraction for Dbpedia. Has there been talk in the Dbpedia community about interacting with the Wikipedia community to make the data more consistent? Do we have any examples of this to date? Dbpedia certainly provides the basis for tools that allow people to police infobox consistency, if we decide to promote that. I also agree with not changing the data in Wikipedia. The [[Barbara Liskov]] example below is really a list and the data within should be retained (perhaps as two values). The intent of the point below really concerns annotation cases. For example with the triple (:Renaissance_Center, dbpedia2:floor_count, \"73 story tower with four 39 story towers and two 21 story towers\"), I'd like to be able to retrieve the value itself (e.g., 73) and have the rest of the text available as an annotation or comment.

If I also knew the associated infobox template, I guess that might be helpful also. I am a little confused by the different dbpedia properties that are associated with some infobox attributes. for example Barack_Obama also has an RDF property 'dbpprop:birthDate' with value 'dbpedia:Barack_Obama/birthDate/birth_date_and_age'.

The process as well as the mappings themselves are still far away from being optimal and we plan to design a proper RDF language to represent the mappings and implement a UI so that external contributors can help to update and extend the mappings. Due to a lack of resources this goes on slow but we hope to make some progress in the next months. Up-to-then, all we can offer are the bits and pieces listed above. Cheers Chris"

The php extraction framework seems to work for this, however - as far as I've understood - the scala framework is faster and generally better. Sadly, when I try to run it, an exception occurs: \"No mappings available for language ru\". Is there really no way to use the scala framework for the Russian wikipedia, or am I missing something? Thank you in advance and sorry if that's a stupid question :) Sincerely yours, Sonya Alexandrova uHi Sonya, there are two different extractors for Infoboxes: the MappingExtractor and the InfoboxExtractor. The MappingExtractor uses mappings defined on but if you are motivated to create some, let us know, you are more than welcome to. ;) The InfoboxExtractor uses our initial, now three year old infobox parsing approach. This extractor extracts all properties from all infoboxes and templates within Wikipedia articles, independently of the language and should also work for Russian. Extracted information is represented using properties in the namespace. However, the quality of these properties is, in general, worse than the mapping based properties.

"FYI: What is an ORCID ID?"	"uI recently posted a question about ORCID identifiers in DBpedia. It occurs to me that some of you may not have encountered the term before; and that many of you will be eligible to use one. An \"Open Research Contributor Identifier\" (ORCID; ), is a UID (which can be expressed as a URI) for researchers and academic and other authors. Think of it as a DoI for people. Mine is shown below. An ORCID disambiguates people with the same or similar names; and identifies works by the same author under different names (changes on marriage, divorce; different spellings or initialisations, etc.) as being by that one person. As the website says: \"ORCID is an open, non-profit, community-driven effort to create and maintain a registry of unique researcher identifiers and a transparent method of linking research activities and outputs to these identifiers\". Several journals and publishers, not least Nature, are including ORCID in their publishing workflows, and institutions are including it in their staff records system. Individuals can sign up for an ORCID at and then include it in their attribution in their research papers, other publications, correspondence and stationery. I encourage you to do so."

"Integrating RML in the DBpedia extraction framework"	"uStudent: Wouter Maroy Mentors: Anastasia Dimou, Dimitris Kontokostas TL;DR; The goal of this GSoC project was to start the integration of RML ( (that all were completed successfully): To read this in a nicely formatted way click here: Introduction DBpedia uses itâs own defined mappings for extracting triples from Wikipedia. The goal of this project was to integrate RML, a general mapping language for triples and replace the original mappings with RML mapping documents. In terms of goals, this project had two main goals and one optional goal. Main goals: - Translate the DBpedia defined mappings to RML mapping documents - Importing RML documents into the extraction framework and converting them to the existing DBpedia mapping data structures Optional goal: - Create a prototype of an integrated RML processor in the DBpedia extraction framework The project was a success. All goals of the project (including the optional goal) were completed and generated successful results. First goal: translating the DBpedia mappings to RML mappings DBpedia uses different types of custom mappings (e.g. simple property mappings, date interval mappings) for extracting triples from Wikipedia infoboxes. These are in general quite complex. Creating one-on-one mappings from DBpedia mappings to RML mappings was no easy task. Designing these mappings required quite some time during the project. We wanted this to be very accurate because the better these translations are, the better the results will be in the end of the process. To create the alignment it was necessary to dive into the exact details of how the DBpedia mappings were used in the extraction framework. In the other way around, it was necessary to fully understand how an RML mapping could produce the same results. All the DBpedia mappings eventually got their RML mapping version. Some mappings were straightforward but most of the cases were very specific and needed a custom solution. The next step was to automate the translation from the original DBpedia mapping files that are stored on GitHub to their corresponding RML version. This has also been done and was implemented in the extraction framework in the server module. Through this functionality it is now possible to access the RML version of every DBpedia mapping that is present on the running server. Second goal: importing and converting RML A first step towards integrating the executing of RML mapping documents is adding a parser that understands RML documents and converts these into a structure the extraction framework understands. To be specific, the extraction framework uses mapping data structures to store itâs loaded mappings. This parser loads the RML mapping documents and converts these to the mapping data structures. The advantage of using this method is that RML documents can be run and generate triples just as if it were using the old mapping documents. There are no big changes needed in the extraction framework itself to make this work. The drawback is that not all functionality of RML is available. Only the specific mappings designed for each DBpedia mapping can be understood and executed by this parser. For all functionality to be available, an RML processor needs to be integrated fully. An implementation of this parser was added to the extraction framework. It can read all the custom design mappings that were created. It is possible for the framework to load and run these mappings. The produced results are very good, the generated triples are the same as if the process would be run with loading the original DBpedia mappings. Optional goal: prototyping an integrated RML processor To make all functionality from RML available a real RML processor is needed. With an integrated RML processor it would be possible to test the mapping documents that were designed during the first part of the project. In the scope of this project an optional goal was to create a prototype to give an idea what is possible. There were some discussions on how this could be implemented and a solution was picked. A prototype was implemented and produced positive results. The generated triples were not all complete, but it served the purpose of a proof-of-concept implementation. The implementation proved that this workflow for integrating the processor is a possible solution if fully implemented. There was no certainty if it would be possible to create this prototype during the scope of this project. It depended on how long it would take to finalize the main goals. Luckily everything went as planned and the optional goal was completed successfully. Links Commits: (unmerged) GSoC Project #6213126861094912"

The good news is we think we found the problem. We found something strange in the update file with triples to delete where things got stuck. The file uses variables, but some of the variables are used more than once. For instance, the file 000981.removed.nt uses the ?o0 and ?o1 variables twice: ?o0 . ?o0 . ?o1 . ?o1 . This is probably the reason why the DELETE query for this file has a higher complexity and tripped Virtuoso up. We changed the code of dbpintegrator slightly to perform a Sparql query per line of this file instead of one query for the entire file. The tool is running without any problems so far. So perhaps something is going wrong in creating the files with the deletion triples?

What do you think about the wrapper? Any ideas for improvements? Cheers Chris uHi Chris, Hi Christian, Very nice, I like it :) My main comments would be that: 1. Right now the HTML rendering of the content doesn't do much for me that I can't get at How about showing some of the data from DBpedia (location/gmap, facts, etc) in the HTML version to demonstrate the power and ease of linked data-based mashups? 2.

It's just sitting there waiting for people to use it if they find it useful. All the point of Linking Open Data is, IMHO: We have data all over the Web in an unbound variety of more or less structured format, with more or less explicit semantics. We have a format (RDF) in which those formats can be migrated using all sorts of heuristics. The benefit of this common format is the ability to link data together in order to further navigate and query them as a single data base (using e.g., SPARQL), based on explicit and open semanticsand all that in an open format. This is work in progress, right? What does that prove? ;-) That to-date Google algorithms and data base are the winner against Linking Open Data? Sure enough. But do you know *how* Google found that? Certainly not, their algorithms are their best kept assets. On Linking Open Data, the way you get answers is perfectly clear and open. Put up a semantic query, and find the triples matching them. If there are not, there are not. You know why. You don't retrieve anything because data are not there. If you feeel like it, publish Linked Data about Ãjebro, and put them in the LOD network. BTW there is already a URI for this place waiting for you to use it : So publish something like foaf:page Add the bridge to geonames data base if you feel like it, using Geonames wiki (there is a \"bridge\" category) , improve matching english Wikipedia article, publish photographs on flickr, whatever > So could you please provide some examples that show which problem The particular tool (flickr wrapper) does not \"solve\" any problem by itself. It augments the content you can access using semantic queries. The more you get of that stuff, the more interlinked it will be, and the more it will prove useful.

I won't subscribe though ;-) I think the point of this project is not to allow people to find photos of things. It's up to Christian to tell us about his motivations for creating this, but on the technical side, this is a data mashup: It combines data from two different openly available datasets, namely photos from Flickr and encyclopaedia articles from Wikipedia. It seems to me like it is doing a pretty good job at finding photos related to some Wikipedia topic from the Flickr pool. It works better for some kinds of topics (e.g. sights) and worse for others (e.g. scientific concepts). Well, typicality is in the eye of the beholder. These photos are what Örebro probably looks like to Flickr community. For you, Örebro might be about that dreary old post-card panorama. For them, Örebro might be about visiting friends and hanging out. Who is to say that you are right and they are wrong? Öjebro is not in Wikipedia and thus not in the flickrwrappr. (Searching for Öjebro on Flickr yields this photo: photos/ka-ka/752430/ ) So how about starting the Wikipedia article? You cannot use these search results in your own app or site without violating Google's TOS and several people's copyright. The Flickr API is open, and photos on Flickr are annotated with license information (often Creative Commons). It solves the problem of finding associations between two public datasets, Wikipedia and Flickr. More to the point, it finds photos with known copyright status related to Wikipedia topics. And I don't know anyone who would suggest that simply using a particular technology solves any problems. Nevertheless, I'd say that RDF is a sensible choice of technology for flickrwrappr because this makes it easy to integrate flickrwrappr results with DBpedia results. Cheers, Richard uHi all, It's simply about enriching DBpedia entries with photos about them. When making a statement \"this is a picture of that concept\", one should be pretty sure about the content, hence we involve geo-coordinates. It works well for lots of sights, museums, maybe even for famous restaurants (if they're so famous that they have a geo-tagged Wikipedia article). So when you're scouting for worthwhile sights in a foreign city, just look at some pictures from the flickr wrappr and you'll get a good idea of what they are about. In cases where we don't have geo-coordinates, the results will not be as good; and as far as cities are concerned, our 1km radius will certainly make no sense, as is pointed out on the website. However it should be fairly easy to filter out these cases and come up with ways to improve results here. Thanks for the note regarding the header encoding, we'll fix it shortly. Cheers, Christian"

"Large amounts of missing georss:point data"	"uDear all, I've only recently started working with dbpedia as a research resource, so I apologize in advance if I'm asking a silly question with an obvious answer. Dbpedia is a wonderful resource, a huge thanks to all of you on the list who are putting hard work into it. It seems to me that there was a recent change to dbpedia that caused a good chunk of information I've been working with to go missing. I've been working with the geographical locations of military conflicts over the past few months, stitching together a dataset from dbpedia triples that linked several thousand battles to their locations via the georss:point predicate. I started rebuilding this dataset this week and it seems that much of that information I saw before is missing. To illustrate, the following query to the SPARQL endpoint at select COUNT(?battle) as ?count where { ?battle rdf:type dbo:MilitaryConflict . ?battle georss:point ?location . } Just to make sure I wasn't going crazy I decided to do essentially the same query to the dbpedia live SPARQL endpoint ( select COUNT(?battle) as ?count where { ?battle rdf:type dbpedia-owl:MilitaryConflict . ?battle georss:point ?location . } This returns 4225 hits, which is more reminiscent of the amount of results I got working with non-live dbpedia a few months ago. So, a few months ago, vanilla dbpedia gave me several thousand results, and dbpedia live right now does the same, but as of recently dbpedia vanilla only returns 11 results. Any reason that this may be the case? Perhaps I'm missing something quite simple? I appreciate any feed back.

I've been working with the MilitaryConflict data so that's the window through which I noticed the missing triples, but since you mentioned there weren't any changes to the conflict mapping I poked around a little more and I'm lead to believe this isn't an issue with dbpedia extracting conflict data and may have to do with geographic coordinates in general. As way of illustration I took a look at the geographic coordinates dataset from the 3.9 downloads, which has 1,987,961 triples, while the corresponding geographic dataset on the 4.0 downloads page has only 2284 triples, which seems like a significant drop for geographic data across the whole dbpedia dataset. Perhaps there were some changes made to the extraction framework for the general extraction of the Wikipedia \"coord\" tag? Hope this information helps.

"Deadline approaching for Wikimania 2016"	"uHi folks, The deadline for submitting a main track proposal to Wikimania 2016 is January 7th: Please note that it concerns the main track, i.e., big competition and Wikimedia-specific critical issues. Based on a recent chat with a Wikimedia folk, there should also be a poster session with many more slots, which in my opinion best fit a DBpedia submission. I have not seen the page discussing this, but there should be one. Cheers,"
"Distributed DBpedia Extraction (Open Beta)"	"uDear all, We are happy to announce an early beta version of Distributed DBpedia Extraction with Hadoop / Spark. Things are still rough but we want beta testers to report their experience - and extraction time of course. :) Read ahead if you are interested Right now we only support extraction, which means that you need to download the dumps with the existing method (distributed downloading is our next step) Setting up the framework and performing a distributed extraction is fairly easy; we have outlined all the details in the README and added a script for firing up a Spark+HDFS cluster quickly on Google Compute Engine. For a single language, the whole extraction job (including redirects) is executed in parallel. If you add multiple languages, all jobs are submitted to Spark, and based upon Sparkâs configured scheduling mode, theyâll be scheduled over the cluster in parallel either in a FIFO (default) or FAIR manner. We did some tests on a small 3-node cluster: 1 master (2 core 7.5G RAM - GCE n1-standard-2), 2 slaves (4 core 15G RAM each - GCE n1-standard-4) with 4 workers on each slave. Using the English Wikipedia, the distributed framework took a total of 3hrs. 21 min. to finish extraction (including the pre-extraction redirects computation). Weâll add more tests and benchmarks to the GitHub wiki pages very soon. Any feedback is more than welcome. We keep track of our future tasks and bugs @GitHub Cheers, Nilesh, Sang & Dimitris Acknowledgements: This project is sponsored by the Google Summer of Code project.

"yago categories in German dbpedia"	"uHi *, (I was redirected from the German dbpedia list[5] to this mailing list). (Btw, sorry for not having the time to further examine the paper which explains yago and dbpedia[1]. I am just pointing to things showing on the surface.) A German wikipedia resource[0] describes a novel and thus is categorizied as literature. Now, their is a the link to \"other languages\", and these resources describe the movie based on that novel. (It's wrong to link theses resources with owl:sameAs, but of course you can only take what's there.) The german dbpedia entry is rdf:typed using a subset of rdf:type clearly coming from the international dbpedia[3]. Now, what makes me curious is: 1. why is for the German dbpedia entry[4] only taken a subset of rdf:type of the English one[3] ? 2. why is no rdf:type reflecting that the resource[4] is (at least) also a novel? (I guess being typed as literature and a movie at the same time is semantically a contradiction, but then it would be fine to mark that contradiction in the dataset.) -o [0] [1] [3] [4] [5] forum.php?thread_name=4FB3E30F.6080503%40gmail.com&forum;_name=dbpedia-germany uHi Pascal, The reason I've asked you to forward the discussion here is because the problem seems to be a bit more general than just limited to the DBpedia German. First of all thanks to your post I noticed that our interlinking script had some bugs in it, forwarded that issue to Dimitris who discovered even more bugs, so now we should have a better Yago categorization in the country chapters. As an answer to your specific questions Because each internationalized DBpedia doesn't directly map yago classes to specific resource, I don't even think we could since Yago is in English(however I have no idea, maybe it would work by defining custom extraction rules and them mapping them to the corresponding English Ontology classes). We use the DBpedia Internationalization Interlinking shell script [1] which goes over the interlanguage links and and copies the Yago categorization from the matching DBpedia.org resource. Because Wikipedia contains incorrect data, as in many other cases. If you look at [2] you will see that the Wikipedia article describes the movie not the novel, however it is linked to an article in the German Wikipedia that describes the novel not the movie [3]. The previous issue results in a mismatch in the Yago categorisation in the german DBpedia endpoint, and can only be remediated by correcting the language links in the English Wikipedia.

"IP blacklist, DBpedia dump 3.7 and Openlinksw Sparql endpoint"	"uHi all, I think one of our IP addresses has been blacklistened by dbpedia servers. We use these addresses just for research purposes within my university. Who should I contact for kindly asking to enable it again? Ok, the obvious answer to this question could be: \"install a local dump of DBpedia and don't bother DBpedia server\". Well, that's what I would really like to do. We used to have dbpedia dumps 3.5. Then, we recently decided to install a brand new fresh version with dump 3.7. The nightmare started. :-) Here's my story. I successfully installed Virtuoso Opensource 6.1.4 (latest version) on a Linux Ubuntu 10.04 64bit distribution with 32GB ram. Then, I tried several times to follow the instructions at: (I successfully did the same a couple of years ago for dump 3.5). Unfortunately, after one hour or two of correct execution, the rdf_loader_run() procedure stucks, the virtuoso-t process result active (at least it seems to be active since a \"ps aux|grep virtuoso\" shows me the process has not been killed), but everything concerning virtuoso seems to be dead: the web interface respond anymore, a \"top\" command from the shell does not show \"virtuoso\" (while in the beginning it used 100% of CPU), the \"isql-v\" command allows me to correctly log in, but then the instructions does not respond. The virtuoso.log file does not show anything wrong. Finally, I've observed (from the virtuoso.log file) some of the .nt files of the dump contain incorrect triples. For example, I get this error message: File /dbpedia-dump/3.7/en/external_links_en.nt error 23000 SR133: Can not set NULL to not nullable column 'DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD.O' The problem is that when such an error is encountered, I think the loading of that file does not go on. In other words, I could lose important triples. Does anyone has any successfully/unsuccessfully experiences about installing DBpedia dump 3.7 on Virtuoso? ps: where is the openlinksw beloved endpoint?

"Skos subject properties are deprecated"	"uHi, I am new to this list, but in a discussion on another list we were discussing the use of the skos:subject and related items, something which dbpedia has invested in heavily to represent the wikipedia category system. The latest SKOS draft has deprecated these properties. What will dbpedia use instead? Peter Ansell uPeter, On 24 Jan 2008, at 05:41, Peter Ansell wrote: Can you give us some background on this decision? I have a hard time understanding why this step was taken. I don't know. Do you have any suggestions? Richard uHello all Some precisions before anyone gets carried away :-) The latest SKOS draft Peter mentions is certainly the editor's draft at This is only an editor's draft and has no official status whatsoever The skos:subject property is mentioned as \"at risk\", which means its relevancy is questioned. It's not *deprecated* so far AFAIK, but under discussion. There are two related \"open issues\" on this former : \"The SKOS model should contain mechanisms to attach a given resource (e.g. corresponding to a document) to a concept the resource is about, e.g. to query for the resources described by a given concept.\" I think this is obvious. Otherwise what is the point of SKOS altogether? The property skos:subject was (and still is) candidate to support this mechanism. As has been pointed in e.g., the other ongoing thread on dbpedia list [1], the term \"subject\" can appear to be too specific in meaning to cover all cases of linking a resource to a concept, and strange in some borderline cases. But it's more a question of terminology than a question of need of such a generic property. In the referenced thread, I think the criticism should be more interpreted as a weird construction of Wikipedia categories (some are very weird indeed) than as a mistake in using skos:subject in DBpedia to represent the Wikipedia categorisation. My take on this is that such a generic property is needed and should not be deprecated. Since a lot of people (including dbpedia folks, but not only) have started using skos:subject in the above quoted very generic sense, and I think they are OK to do so, it should be kept as is. But it should be put in best practices that whenever you want to specify an indexing property, you define a specific subproperty of skos:subject. SKOS specification should stress and explain what the *functional* semantics of this property are, and are not. Simply to *retrieve resources* indexed on a concept. Not to infer any specific semantics on the indexing link. Just : \"If you are interested in this concept, here are resources dealing about it in some way\". No more, no less. If you want to be more specific, use a specific subproperty. Bernard [1] Richard Cyganiak a écrit : uAll, I agree with Bernard that SKOS needs a property for attaching resources to concepts. The problem with skos:subject at the moment is this: The Core Guide gives the impression that the domain of skos:subject is documents only. But there is no explicit domain declared in the vocabulary definition. Furthermore, several parties (e.g. DBpedia) have a clear need for a property that relates non-document resources to skos:Concepts. I think there are three options for resolving this: A) Clarify that the domain of skos:subject is indeed any resource, and that the term subject is used loosely here. B) Clarify that the domain of skos:subject is documents only, and introduce a new super-property of skos:subject that explicitly covers any resource. It could be named for example skos:category, or skos:indexedAs. C) Clarify that the domain of skos:subject is documents only, and leave the task of defining a property non-document resources to others. My preference would be, in that order, B), A), C).

My problem is not with the term resource, but with the term subject. I don't doubt that DC properties, in general, are applicable to all kinds of resources. But some sorts of resources don't really have subjects. Best, Richard uLeonard, and all Leonard's point goes along the same line as my previous message. Let's extend the notion of document to be equivalent to \"resource\", and we're done. That was all the point of the URI specification to begin with. Another hit on that nail : The notion of document is extended in many ways in various communities to anything bearing information. The first information on a thing being to be made distinct from the continuum of the universe, through naming, identifying, and asserting distinctive properties (such as a URI), as long as something is identified, it bears information, hence can be considered a document. A bit farfetched maybe, but closing the debate, conceptually and technically. Bernard PS : I vote for \"A\", of course.

See references, including Simon's reference to Otlet Note that this way older than most of us are, even including myself :-) I would not say \"TimBL's description on Wikipedia\", but \"TimBL as defined in his Wikipedia description\" If that case, the problem would not be in DBpedia interpretation, but in Wikipedia categorisation, which should change then to, well, say \"Dating profile\"?. The real problem here is to know if TimBL has only one identity, defined by a single URI (or the set of all its owl:sameAs equivalents), to which a consistent set of assertions can be attached. Seen at the level of current DBpedia, the answer is assumed to be \"yes\". But the more precisely you will look at it, the more you will need to split this so-called individual in a cluster of avatars (the child, the student, the CERN engineer, the tax-payer, the patient, the Web inventor, etc ), which will at some point need different URIs and different descriptions if you want to keep some consistency. That will happen first in Wikipedia, when an article will be split in several ones, because the subject description has gained in complexity and accuracy. I guess DBpedia will synchronise, but what will happen to deprecated URIs? Astronomers know that, a single star to the naked eye is a multiple system in instruments, the number of components growing with the power of the instrument. In brief, looking closely at any thing leads most of the time to the loss of its identity/individuality. This fractal and evolving nature of reality we'll need to take into account in our systems, when semantics go beyond the naive notion of the world as a set of well-identified, pre-existing things. We've just started scratching the surface of all this I'm afraid. Bernard uAntoine, On 24 Jan 2008, at 18:08, Antoine Isaac wrote: I love this example! The common sense part of my brain says: What are these guys smoking? While the purely logically trained part of my brain says: Yes, this makes total sense. Obviously an antelope in a zoo is a document. It's a fascinatingly complicated issue. I don't think it would be problematic. I want to put the man into the history of the net bucket, not any particular description of him. The description's purpose is just to establish whom we are talking about. TimBL is about the history of the net is a weird statement, I agree with you on that point (and probably disagree with Bernard). But that's part of my argument for a new property: I feel that A skos:subject B carries a certain implication, in natural language, that A is about B. I would prefer having another property that does not carry that implication. A skos:indexedIn B uRichard Cyganiak wrote: uHi I'm only starting to stroll in the foothills of mount semantic web but I have been attempting to use skos subjects in the mashups I've been experimenting with so I'm risking a probably naive intrusion into this debate . One of my mashups is a map of football stadiums in England: in which I make use of the skos:subject dbpedia:Football_venues_in_England in the underlying SPARQL query but if I take a typical resource (Abbey Stadium in Cambridge) in this category I find these skos:subjects: * dbpedia:Category:Buildings_and_structures_in_Cambridgeshire * dbpedia:Category:Cambridge * dbpedia:Category:Cambridge_United_F.C. * dbpedia:Category:Football_venues_in_England These are all logically redundant * dbpedia:Category:Cambridge - is the same as p:location * dbpedia:Category:Cambridge_United_F.C. is inverse of dbpedia:Cambridge_United_F.C. p:ground ?r * dbpedia:Category:Football_venues_in_England should be deducible given Cambridge_United is a football club (although this is not obviously so in the dbpedia data) * dbpedia:Category:Buildings_and_structures_in_Cambridgeshire is a conjunction of rdfs:type yago:Building102913152 and some geo data set which knows that Cambridge is in Cambridgeshire) This leads me to think that wikipedia categories are (nearly?) always redundant derived relationships which, since manually created or roboted) are likely to be also imperfect. Since there is no end to the derived relationships which could be materialised into such categories, perhaps it's a waste of time wondering what they really are or perhaps they should be labeled as derivedRelationship and linked to the rule which is their basis.

"DBpedia as Tables release"	"uDear all, We are happy to announce the first version of the DBpedia as Tables tool [1]. As some of the potential users of DBpedia might not be familiar with the RDF data model and the SPARQL query language, with this tool we provide some of the core DBpedia 3.9 data in tabular form as Comma-Separated-Values (CSV) files, which can easily be processed using standard tools, such as spreadsheet applications, relational databases or data mining tools. For each class in the DBpedia ontology (such as Person, Radio Station, Ice Hockey Player, or Band) we provide a single CSV file which contains all instances of this class. Each instance is described by its URI, an English label and a short abstract, the mapping-based infobox data describing the instance (extracted from the English edition of Wikipedia), and geo-coordinates (if applicable). Altogether we provide 530 CSV files in the form of a single ZIP file (size 3 GB compressed and 73.4 GB uncompressed). More information about the file format as well as the download link can be found on the DBpedia as Tables Wiki page [1]. Any feedback is welcome!

For all who want to import data into Postgresql, I've written a python script which automatically creates the SQL corresponding to the CSV: The column types (ofter arrays) are inferred from your headers and the data rows; indexes are also created. (If people here find this script useful, I could also package it for pypi and improve documentation a bit.) I was assuming that your files are encoded in UTF-8, which worked, but I didn't find either a '\"\"' or a '\\"' inside a field value, so I don't know how a '\"' would be encoded, if there were one. Also for a multi-value field (e.g. '{1|2|3}') I don't know how '{', '|' and '}' are encoded, if they appear within one of the values. - Maybe you could add some documentation on that. In your data I found 2 format problems (I don't think my download went wrong, but anyway, a checksum might be helpful): * Film.csv seems to have no headers (it has 20004 lines for me). * Aircraft.csv: the 2nd last row ( \" ) has too many columns.

"My first SPARQL test"	"uDear dpbedia discussion mailing list, I'm trying to make nice queries to show the power of SPARQL to fellow researchers. I found it quite hard to get started to drill down to the correct query format. Let me describe my workflow of constructing my first query. Maybe you can point out how I could have done better. First I came up with a question: \"List the universities of the Netherlands in order of establishment\". I used the \"select distinct ?Concept where {[] a ?Concept} LIMIT 100\" query at construct my query. With CTRL-F I searched for 'University' and found the concept \" Next I used: \"prefix schema: select distinct ?uni where {?uni a schema:CollegeOrUniversity}\" I found many USA colleges and universities and went to the dbpedia page of one of them. There I found the country and established property. Now I used a Python script with the SPARQLWrapper library to do my next query (I want to be able to get the output in command line). I ended up with the following query: PREFIX dbpedia-owl: PREFIX dbpedia: PREFIX dbpprop: SELECT ?est ?name WHERE { ?uni a dbpedia-owl:University. ?uni dbpedia-owl:country dbpedia:Netherlands. ?uni dbpprop:nativeName ?name. ?uni dbpprop:established ?est } ORDER BY ?est LIMIT 100 But the results show 3 weird glitches: 1) The \"Conservatorium Maastricht\" ( property of 19. I searched for the reason for this weird number and found that the wikipedia article had 19?? stated as the established date in all the articles before the 12 October 2011 revision. My question with this glitch is: Can we add the revision information in the rdf triples of dbpedia? That makes it easier to find out why a particular problem occurs and it shows how current the information is. 2) The \"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven\" ( established property of 23. I think this is due to the fact that this property is parsed as an xsd:integer, which only works if it only contains a year of establishment, but we can see on entire date is given in the infobox. Instead of finding 1956, it uses the first number it encounters. 3) The \"International University in Hospitality Management\" ( that seems to be a floating point value. I could not find the cause of this. Do these problems occur often in dbpedia? How can I report them properly? Is this the correct place (I cannot access the bugtracker)? Is this the 'normal' workflow to construct queries to dbpedia? Can I suggest to add the 'retrieved_from_revision' relation to the resources?

"DBPedia dump - Categories (Skos) - other languages ?"	"uDear All, I just found out about this very nice Categories extract in SKOS format. But from what I see, there is only the english version. Is there a way to get this kind of feature for other languages ? (I am looking for french and chinese) Thanks for any answer Fabian Cretton uHello, the same problem exists for the German DBpedia [1]. The general problem is that English URIs are used and only data is included, if a matching English article is produced. We are currently working on making the code language independent. i.e. the French MediaWiki category namespace is probably not 'Category:' but 'Catégories:' encoded: Cat%E9gories:, so once we have that sorted out, there will be more language specific versions. We are currently still optimizing the live extraction, after that this is the next on the list. If you are really interested, you might help us and try to run the extraction yourself and see what faulty data it produces. Checkout [2] and configure and run extract_test.php with the article category extractor. You can already configure, that uri should look like dbpedia.ini and compare with dbpedia_default.ini) But it is still a long way to go.

The previous %-encoding of comma and ampersand is a bug that will be corrected in the next release.

Then each byte is represented by the 3-character string \"%xy\", where xy is the two-digit hexadecimal representation of the byte. - Furthermore, multiple underscores are collapsed into one.

"Some thoughts about cities and buildings"	"uI've been poking about a bit and found the following things: (1) The browser at Google's Chrome. Works OK for me in Firefox (2) I'd like to see more definite comments for the items. For instance, I'd like to see something in the definition of 'City' that gives a specific answer to the Tokyo and London question. If this isn't stated somewhere, things are either going to be random or we'll be having edit wars. Personally I'd be willing to put my opinion in there, but I'd like to see some process as to how this gets done. (3) There is no one simple reason for why the city assignments get lost because the infobox mappings are pretty complicated. For instance, places like Manchester NH, NYC and Sao Paulo have an Infobox:Settlement, and the \"City\" designation should be triggered by settlement_type = City I noticed however, that Manchester has settlement_type = [[City]] which is \"reasonable\" (certainly reflects linked data thinking) but I don't know if the extractor is going to get that. On the other hand, if you look at the entry for Dresden, Dresden has Infobox:German_Location and the \"Citiness\" of Dresden is triggered by the line Art = City in the infobox. There's also an Infobox for Japanese_City, so I'm sure that there are a lot of details. (4) If there's a root cause for the problem, it's that there isn't a closed feedback loop. If you're looking at this as a problem of \"transforming something from form A to form B\" it's clear that the system produces \"B\". It's only when you actually try to use \"B\" that you find that \"B\" is full of holes. Overall it's a system problem: I'm sure that we can get better results by changing the extractor rules (in fact, we'll get the fastest gains this way) but that some changes to Wikipedia content be necessary too. The complexity of the infoboxes means that an agent that does these corrections could be a bit complex, although its behavior could probably be controlled by the infobox mappings. For instance, it may end up doing something a bit different for a \"German Location\" than it would for a \"Settlement\". Along the way it's also tempting to do some canonicalization. For instance, the word \"City\" in the infobox header for NYC is just plain text, but the word \"City\" for Manchester NH is a hyperlink. You can make a case for both, but from a quality standpoint, the same thing should be done in both cases. In the case of the German locations I see that the English words \"Town\" and \"City\" are often used in the \"type\" and \"art\" fields, but the word \"Stadt\" is treated by the framework as if were synonymous with \"Town\", which, from what little German I know, isn't quite right (isn't Munich a /Großstadt/?) . But perhaps the word \"Stadt\" has some special semantics in the context of Wikipedia, and it ought to be preserved"
"Concept Identifiers"	"uHello, How are concept IDs handled for DBpedia? It looks like the concept URIs are descriptive (i.e. for the concept the concept ID is \"Solar_System\"). Are the descriptive IDs used throughout all of dbpedia (back and front end) or are terms ultimately kept unique by using numeric identifiers? I've been developing a controlled vocabulary and I would also like to use URIs so that my terms can be used with other linked data schemes. My group and I have had a lot of discussions regarding the concept IDs; some want them to be descriptive, based on the preferred term for each concept so that they are human readable but this could cause problems if the terms used to describe each concept change over time, others want them to be randomly generated so that if the description of a term drifts over time the URI for the concept will always remain static. We are trying to figure out if there are any standards or best practices we should be looking towards when it comes to concept IDs. Any thoughts/comments/justifications would be appreciated. Best, Katie uDear Katie, DBpedia mostly uses descriptive URIs that are based on the titles of Wikipedia articles in a specific language. These URIs change if pages are renamed, but for many concepts, this does not occur so often. You would probably only notice it if you are using the URIs for several years. If you instead want to use numeric IDs based on Wikipedia pages (or DBpedia URIs), you can take them from Wikidata. These IDs are stable, but not descriptive. They are kept unique in that they can only be deleted but not reused. For example, The Wikidata URI uses content negotiation to redirect you to the HTML page if you open it in a browser, and to RDF if you open it with an RDF crawler. See direct links to the RDF content. To manually find out what the Wikidata ID is for a Wikipedia page, you can go to the Wikipedia page and use the link to \"Wikidata item\" on the left. To do this in an automated fashion, you can use the SPARQL endpoint, e.g., with the query SELECT * WHERE { schema:about ?item . } (try it in the Wikidata SPARQL UI: The Wikidata Web API can also map page titles to IDs for you prefer JSON over SPARQL: Each of these methods can also be used to fetch many IDs at once. So basically it is fairly straightforward to translate from DBpedia URIs to Wikidata URIs. The mapping between the two changes over time only when DBPedia URIs change their meaning (e.g., if \"Solar System\" is renamed to \"Solar System (astronomy)\" or something).

Or, if there are no best practices, then what is the reason DBpedia is using descriptive IRIs (sounds like dbpedia uses descriptive because thats what wikipedia uses, fair enough!). You did raise an interesting question regarding the granularity and how the change of a description might also signify a change in the understanding of the concept. We will have to think on this! Best, Katie uDear Markus, Thank you for the insight. We might also try to assign both numeric and descriptive IDs to a concept. It seems as though best practices don't really exist in this area, other than the general imperative to keep the URIs simple and as stable as possible. Best, Katie uClarifying: The function of an ID (identifier) is to identity a concept, not to describe it. So they must be unique by definition, a concept can not have multiple IDs . Multiple concepts may be equivalent to one another, but that doesn't mean they are the same. If you have two different IDs (i.e. the Unicode comparison of the strings results in mismatch) you have by definition two different concepts. That is not what you want. You want multiple labels for the same concept/ID. The description of a concept (or definition, philosophically speaking) is the whole group of other properties you ascribe to the concept by referencing its ID, including as may human readable labels as you need and relations to other concepts. You can choose to use an automatic generated ID in order to guarantee uniqueness or use manually ascribed human readable strings, but with the later you must guarantee the uniqueness by process (as is the case with DBpedia IDs, which are derived from Wikipedia IDs). It is not a RDF requirement for the IRIs to be simple (although that saves parsing time) or human readable, but they MUST be unique and stable, otherwise the identity of the concept is compromised. Human readable IDs are only helpful in manual edition of files, which happens only in examples and didactic purposes. Real world IDs are mostly UUIDs (universally unique IDs) generated by the system (for Java, see java.util.UUID ). Some systems use prefixed URLs in order to embed provenance into the ID, but that is a very, very bad practice: provenance is metadata as any other, you should use specific properties for that. IDs were not designed to provide any other semantics besides identity. Cheers.

I don't think there are universally agreed best practices in this space and people often have strongly held views on either side. You don't mention internationalization/localization which is, in my experience, a bigger concern for folks than semantic drift. Those who believe in numeric identifiers often think that using identifiers in a given natural language provides that language an undeserved pride of place and priority over other languages. Folks in this camp include the creators of CIDOC and there are people dismayed by BibFrame's abandonment of MARC-style numbers. sensible in the abstract, suffer from the weak tools that we have, so end up disadvantaging everyone equally, but everyone more than English identifiers probably would. Your note implies that concept URIs could change over time if they had natural language words as part of the URI. I don't think this would be a good practice. If UAT:Black now means \"orange,\" I think you need to either live with UAT:Black as the URI, mint a synonym UAT:Orange (and keep UAT:Black), or deprecate UAT:Black as a valid concept and create a new concept UAT:Orange. Which course of action is most appropriate will depend on the specific circumstances of a change. If you decide there's a new concept UAT:DarkGrey, that is split off from UAT:Black, perhaps the original can exist unchanged, but if you decide that there's really no such thing as \"black\" but just UAT:DarkGrey and UAT:DarkestGrey, then perhaps UAT:Black gets deprecated and removed. Changing the pieces of URI to UAT101, UAT102, UAT301, etc doesn't really affect most of the discussion. The only case it makes easier is avoid UAT:Black having a description of \"vibrant orange,\" if the concept drifts far enough from its original label (which is embedded in the URI). Since Dimitris mentioned Freebase, briefly what they did was initially mint English language URIs based on the label of the topic, but eventually abandoned the practice because it was too difficult to do automatically and added too little value. They did keep English identifiers for types & properties which were part of the scheme, but these were hand assigned and provided a useful organizing function to group properties with the associated type, types with their domain, etc. A powerful feature of the Freebase setup was that a single topic could have arbitrarily many URIs, so dereferencing /en/Boston, /authority/viaf/1234, /authority/loc/lcnam/nm1234, /wikipedia/en_title/Boston (city), etc could all fetch the same the same content (without the use of redirects). The core identifiers for non-schema topics were machine generated sequential IDs encoded with a compact base 37(?) encoding, e.g. /m/0d_23 Tom p.s. I'm a couple of blocks away if you want to chat about this stuff some time.

It is certainly not the case that identifiers must be unique by definition. Every identifier must identify a unique object, but a single object can have multiple identifiers. This is standard meaning of \"identifier\" applies to URIs just as well as to IDs in databases and all kinds of other areas. Requiring that every concept can only be identified in one way would make things very hard in decentralised data ecosystems such as LOD. In fact, it would already cause problems in individual databases, which often need to merge identifiers as they improve over time (e.g., MusicBrainz Ids 2ca98ac1-62f0-4cdc-89ad-9d4b7602440a and 6a10f49d-e7db-40d3-a348-bbd5717ebbbe refer to the same concept).

Named IDs work best on closed domains where names/labels change very rarely. Names of places are maybe the best example, since you can use their relative location to make them unique, e.g., the dmoz id for Dresden is: \"Regional/Europe/Germany/States/Saxony/Localities/Dresden/\" This is a domain where named IDs work really well. Several scientific IDs also are great in this respect. Other domains are not so easy to handle but are still working fairly well. Humans are a good example: they change their names relatively rarely, but they cannot be identified by the name alone. You need to add something else to achieve uniqueness of the ID. For example, Tim Berners-Lee's ID as a Fellow of the Royal Society is \"timothy-berners-lee-11074\". So this would be a mixed approach. For other domains, named IDs are doable but not nice (not even for humans). Movies and books are typical examples of areas where labels are quite complicated to work with (they are not unique, they can be very long, and they can have all kinds of weird symbols and markup). This is probably why the vast majority of databases and catalogues in such areas are using opaque, numeric IDs. And then, finally, there is the big class of cross-domain data where labels can have complicated forms, clash often, and change all the time. Wikipedia, Freebase, and Wikidata are dealing with this. Here it is rather tricky to maintain stable named IDs, and indeed Wikipedia does not work very well as an ID provider. Reuse of the same IDs for a variety of things is the main problem here. I like the approach you had in Freebase, using opaque IDs for stability but supporting additional (possibly domain-specific) IDs to ease use. Some databases already have something similar, e.g., TED has two speaker IDs for Tim Berners-Lee: If I would implement a system like the one Katie might have in mind, I would still use the opaque IDs and then display nice labels to the user within my tool. A properly formatted label is always better than the best of URIs when you want to show it to a user (\"ted:tim_berners_lee\" vs. \"Tim Berners-Lee\"). Raw RDF tools cannot be expected to provide this level of (end-)user friendliness, but many of the higher-level tools I am seeing today are working with labels (in multiple languages) without big problems.

From my experience: If you have a more static set of Ids, e.g. for planets of the Solar system, chemical elements, countires of the european union, descriptive IDs are fine. There might be some change, but it is minimal. For highly dynamic entities, e.g. names and events and opinions extracted from text you should definitely use UUIDs Anything in between can be a mixture, e.g. like an md5 hash over the most relevant properties.

De facto, UNA produces contradictions as soon as you want to state that to things are the same. So owl:sameAs would not make sense combined with UNA as it would always cause contradictions, except in the reflexive case. Just because you are not unifying merging identifiers right away does not imply UNA. there are SPARQL tools that throw a contradiction, if they encounter owl:sameAs OWL was designed to handle multiple identifiers. This affects the modeling in a way that it is fine to have several IDs. DBpedia as such uses this. Below are all ID's for DBpedia Berlin., where the first one is the canonical one. A good idea might be to provide as well in the future. We are working on a service that allows to canonicalize all DBpedia Ids, which is only legit as there is no UNA intended in OWL. All the best, Sebastian uÿØÿà uHi Sebastian, I'll try to clarify further. This really is a tricky topic and maybe more than an email thread is needed to explain this. If you want to dive into the details, you may want to check out some textbooks to get started (Abiteboul et al. would be the standard intro to database theory and Relational Algebra; for FOL there are many choices, but there is no DL-specific textbook; there are some good DL tutorials, however, that may be useful). I don't know of a good reference that explains the differences that are causing confusion here. On 01.06.2016 17:03, Sebastian Hellmann wrote: Sorry, but you are mixing up things again here. Being \"similar\" is not enough to establish a logical relationship between two formalisms. Eve the underlying logic (FOL here) is just one aspect. OWL semantics is based on *entailment* of logical consequences in FOL. In contrast, Relational Algebra is based on *model checking* with respect to finite FOL models. The two tasks are totally and fundamentally different (model checking is PSpace complete, entailment checking is undecidable, for a start). It's beyond this thread to explain all details relevant here, and the somewhat vague notion of \"UNA\" does not really do it justice either (UNA is really a property of a logic's model theory, but does not tell you whether you are doing model checking or entailment). \"Simple semantics\" is the most basic way of interpreting RDF graphs. If you would like to know more, then you could start with the spec: Most SPARQL processors do not go beyond this, though their semantics is specified differently (based on model checking rather than on entailment, which makes it more natural to talk about, e.g., negation and aggregates). Nevertheless, the simple semantics is kind of built into the SPARQL BGP semantics already, so you cannot do anything less if you implement SPARQL. I cannot make sense of these sentences. UNA is a property of the semantics you use, which in turn is determined by the tool (reasoner) you apply. You cannot \"imply UNA\" uHi, Interesting discussion. One point that I do not think has been evaluated here is the time, location and context components of a statement. The assignment of an identifier is simply a statement made about a concept that instantiates it as an entity. That statement is bound to a time, location and context and the notions of persistence and uniqueness are interpretations from that singular point of view. In a modal reality, an infinite set of identifiers exists for any given concept. The imposition of a uniqueness constraint on an identity is decidable only within a well-known (and highly administered) domain. CIDOC has a property called \"P48 has preferred identifier\" with an owl:Restriction maxCardinality of \"1\". This seems to be a reasonable solution to the question of identifiers. Many identifiers can exist (and usually do), but there can be only one \"preferred identifier\" for a resource in a given ontology.

"Collaboration talks Wikidata - (Dutch) DBpedia"	"uHi all, I don't know whether this is the right mailing list, but here is my report on the talks I had with two Dutch Wikidata people. Would you agree with the proposal we worked out? Regards, Gerard A common project for Wikidata and DBpedia Gerard Kuys, February 12, 2014 At the Dutch Chapter meeting at the 1st DBpedia Community Meeting in Amsterdam, we decided to embark on a trajectory of closer collaboration with the Wikidata project. The idea was to compare datasets and think of ways to mutually improve data quality by way of comparing one dataset to another. The monuments dataset was suggested to be one of the candidate datasets. In order to determine further steps to be taken in this collaboration effort, Gerard Meijssen of Wikidata contacted the GLAM liaison officer of the Dutch Wikimedia Foundation, Sebastiaan ter Burg. With Sebastiaan and with Hay Kranen, Wikipedian in residence at the Royal Library of the Netherlands, I had a fruitful conversation on Tuesday, March 11. On the path towards better quality of data, both Wikidata and DBpedia encounter obstacles to be cleared away. At Wikidata, Hay has pleaded for including the Dutch (and German?) PPN identifier for books, authors and keywords into the list of external identifiers that is kept within Wikidata. However, this proposal was rejected so far, on the grounds that it was insufficiently clear to the Wikidata project members what exactly this NTA field (as it is known in Wikidata circles) would contribute. At DBpedia, on the other hand, we meet with the problem of registering data about peoples gender, which cannot be extracted from Wikipedia articles due to editors policies and has to be obtained by way of linking to external datasets. The major issue to be solved, however, is how to overcome the boundaries between content compartments that spring from institutions collections being separately donated or otherwise brought into Wikipedia (either the encyclopedia or Commons). What we need is finding a way of constructing relations between content across domains. By doing so, we probably also would facilitate the feedback loop donating institutions are eagerly waiting for. When trying to settle for the domains that are most fit for comparison between Wikidata and DBpedia, we identified two domains: Writers and Monuments data. As a first step, we would want to make comparable dumps of data from either source, and work out an approach for finding all kinds of omissions and errors, and mending them. To be overly ambitious, however, as soon as this work has been done, we would want to take the bolder step and link both domains one to another: how could we find the relations (and translate them into RDF(S) properties) expressing the semantic relation between a person (mostly writers) and any building he or she has had a (documented) connection with. Being the GLAM liaison within the Wikimedia Foundation, Sebastiaan is keen to foster this endeavour wherever possible. He will be offering all kinds of support Wikimedia can provide: meeting rooms and the paying of travel expenses. Wikimedia could also provide due publicity, which might be helpful if we would want to attract volunteers who could help monitor data quality wherever there is no automated way to do so. The main work to be done yet remains with the Wikidata and DBpedia communities. We agreed that we would better limit the number of meetings between (working groups within) both communities. Nonetheless, a kick-off meeting would be nice, and useful to have. We think of two types of meetings: 1. * An initial meeting to set up a working approach, identify, divide and attribute work to be done 2. * One or several follow-up meetings to discuss progress and tackle problems that have arisen and cannot possibly be solved by way of skype conferences. This kind of meeting could be held within the framework of ordinary Wikimedia meetings, like the Wiki Saturdays. As soon as both Dutch Wikidata and Dutch DBpedia communities will have approved of this approach (or rather  this is what we hope for), a date for the initial meeting could be fixed.

"Query based on type"	"uHi, I've tried some sample queries with SPARQL. I would want to know, how to write a query which should fetch different properties based on type. For example: With a given \"KEYWORD\", if the KEYWORD is a city name, the query should fetch the country, population, etc., if the KEYWORD is a person name, the same query should fetch the date of birth, Known for, etc., Is it possible to write a query like that?! Even if it is possible, whether it would be efficient? If it is not the right way, then how can I get such type based information? If the question is too simple, please do forgive me. Is there any reference URL to learn such querying(More than the basic queries)? Thanks, Naga Hi, I&#39;ve tried some sample queries with SPARQL.

"dbpedia lookup service"	"uHello, I am currently writing a thesis on web tables and I am using the DBPedia lookup service (prefix search) to link string in web tables to DBPedia URIs. I would like to provide information in my thesis on how the lookup works, but I cannot find any information on the web. Are there any papers I could cite that describe the lookup service? If not, I would be grateful, if someone could provide a short summary of what the lookup is based on, e.g. string similarity to labels, page rank of the wikipedia page, etcThanks in advance. Mark uThe DBpedia lookup uses a context independent approach that was last described, if I am not mistaken, on Georgi Kobilarov's paper with the BBC folks. We also describe some of the data that Lookup uses in our LREC'12 paper about DBpedia for NLP datasets. But the best way to know for sure is to take a look at the source code on github. :-) That being said, I think it would be more fair if you compared your solution to DBpedia Spotlight, which has context aware scoring and will use the words in the table to try to guess a URI for each cell.

I'm also quite interested in trying to add some new functionality to the lookup tool, geospatial search in particular. To do this I first need to be able to build a new index though! I was wondering if anybody had any code or advice for building the surface forms? I have a simple bash (sed + perl) script that parses the links in the wikipedia dumps and seems to work OK, but the parsing is fairly simplistic when it comes to some of the wiki syntax.

"Problems with URI access?"	"uHi For the last couple of days I've had trouble using basic uri-based access to DBpedia, either through a browser or a simple Squeak client. Both were working fine in December. For example, trying to load the following page gives a truncated response. In fact it seems that every DBpedia response is being truncated to a multiple of 4096 bytes. This situation is happening from my workplace, which does sit behind some fairly heavy firewall mechanismsbut, as I say, it used to work. By contrast, through my home Internet connection the Web browsers (IE7 and Firefox) get full, uncorrupted responses. Squeak was still getting truncated ones until I made it put \"HTTP/1.1\" into its requests rather than \"HTTP/1.0\". That seemed to solve the problem - but only at home. I see that there has been a server change recently, as well as the upgrade to 3.0. Possibly related? Thanks - Aran uAran, Looks like a bug in OpenLink Virtuoso, which is now the front-end web server (instead of Apache) sitting in front of the Java webapp that generates the HTML pages. The bug can be easily reproduced: curl -0 which gives a truncated result. The -0 argument forces HTTP/1.0. Kingsley, any chance for a quick bugfix?

"Template not showing in statistics?"	"uEnglish Wikipedia has a template called \"Singlechart\" that is used on many (~10 000) musical singles[1]. However, the DBpedia statistics page doesn't show any uses of this template at all[2]. Is there something special about this template? [1]: [2]: uHi Rob, tl;dr: Singlechart is excluded on purpose. Including it may make sense, and we could probably even define a useful mapping for it (as an IntermediateNodeMapping [3], to attach its data to the main resource for the single). If you want that to happen, feel free to file an issue :-) [4] Boring details: At some point, DBpedia realized that some templates are not very helpful (IntermediateNodeMapping didn't exist at the time) and added a heuristic to exclude them. Only templates that have at least two named properties and at least 75% named properties are extracted. See lines 120 and 121 in InfoboxExtractor [1]: val countExplicitPropertyKeys = propertyList.count(property => !property.key.forall(_.isDigit)) if ((countExplicitPropertyKeys >= minPropertyCount) && (countExplicitPropertyKeys.toDouble / propertyList.size) The settings are in InfoboxExtractorConfig [2]: val minPropertyCount = 2 val minRatioOfExplicitPropertyKeys = 0.75 The Singlechart template fails this test. Examples: {{singlechart|Austria|4|artist=Frankie Goes To Hollywood|song=Relax}} two unnamed, two named = 50% named {{Singlechart|Hungary|7|artist=Celine Dion|song=I Drove All Night|year=2003|week=23|accessdate=11 October 2014}} two unnamed, five named = 71.4% named It usually has at least two named properties, but never at least 75% named properties. But InfoboxExtractorConfig also contains this comment: // When you generate statistics, set the following to true. To get full coverage, you should // probably set most other parameters here to zero or empty values. If we set minPropertyCount = 0 and minRatioOfExplicitPropertyKeys = 0.0, Singlechart would be included, but probably many other templates of dubious usefulness, so some other parts of the system would probably have to be changed as well. The heuristic should probably be refined, not abandoned. Cheers, JC [1] [2] [3] [4] On 9 July 2014 09:23, Rob Hunter < > wrote: > [2]: >"

"Problem with DBPedia SPARQL endpoint"	"uHi, I have a problem with a DBPedia SPARQL endpoint. When I am on the PREFIX foaf: select distinct ?s where { ?s foaf:name ?o . FILTER regex(str(?o), \"^Brad\") } And this error occurred : Virtuoso S1T00 Error SR171: Transaction timed out SPARQL query: define sql:big-data-const 0 #output-format:text/html define sql:signal-void-variables 1 define input:default-graph-uri PREFIX foaf: select distinct ?s where { ?s foaf:name ?o . FILTER regex(str(?o), \"^Brad\") } The same thing occurred when I add a LIMIT. Its because my SPARQL query is wrong or for other else ? Thanks in advance. Regards. uHello Julien, Your query takes so long that it runs over the limits set on the dbpedia endpoint at this time. I ran the query on the dbpedia.org cluster it took 779139 msec which is about 13 minutes to run your original query and return 1441 rows. The problem with your query is the REGEX function which basically forces a table scan on the data as this cannot be done via an index to speed the query up. Note that since you use the DISTINCT keyword, the virtuoso cluster basically cannot shortcut the query. The good news is that Virtuoso has a couple of options that you can use to speed up your query: 1. Use an ANYTIME query This means that you fill in the \"Execution Timeout\" field in the / sparql form with say a value of 5000 (in msec) which means that your query basically is transformed into: Select all the triples that satisfy where the predicate is foaf:name and where the string of the name begins with Brad, that you can find within about 5 seconds of processing, and then return the unique ?subject. Obviously this will not return all the triples you might expect, but it does return quickly. 2. Use BIF:CONTAINS Virtuoso can search very efficiently on the ?o as it maintains a complete freetext index on it. You can use the following query: PREFIX foaf: select distinct ?s where { ?s foaf:name ?o . ?o bif:contains \"Brad\" . } which will basically return every triple that contains the word Brad anywhere in the foaf:name. This is very very efficient, but will get you not only people like: \"Brad Davis\"@en \"Brad Strickland\"@en but also \"Edward Brad Titchener\"@en You can combine this with the FILTER if you really only want foaf:name that start with Brad and use: PREFIX foaf: select distinct ?s where { ?s foaf:name ?o . ?o bif:contains \"Brad\" . FILTER regex(str(?o), \"^Brad\") } Since the bif:contains works over a very efficient index, the FILTER only has to go through a very small number of triples and still return the exact same result you would have expected from your original query. Hope this solves your problem. Patrick uThanks for your help, it works fine :-) I also found this solution which works fine too and it not depends of a Virtuoso endpoint : PREFIX rdf: PREFIX rdfs: SELECT DISTINCT ?s WHERE { { SELECT DISTINCT ?s WHERE { ?s rdfs:label ?o ; rdf:type yago:AmericanFilmActors . FILTER regex(str(?o), \"^Brad\") . } LIMIT 100 } } I don't have all the results but if I put this query in a loop with a OFFSET this should be good. Thanks again for your quickly answer. Regards."

Peter Coetzee and I here at KMi will investigate generating an RDFS class hierarchy from the YAGO data, and providing this back to you guys for import into Virtuoso, which can then (pretty much) solve the dereferencing issue. I like option 1 the best. It leaves the door open for many complementary class hierarchies to be used, and clearly distinguishes each one. From speaking to Chris this seemed a good way to proceed. On that basis we will very shortly (next few days) start to use classes such as , and assume the capitalisation of the classes (also subject to the syntax discussion above).

The reason to use SKOS is that is it designed specifically to represent and describe knowledge bases for a wide variety of ontological formalisms from controlled vocabularies, to thesauri, to tags and folksonomies to RDFS itself, etc. Just as FOAF (people), DOAP (projects), SIOC (semantic communities) or GeoNames (places; see [1]) are the preferred RDFS vocabularies in their respective domains, so should SKOS be considered for knowledge bases. The specific properties in SKOS such as prefLabel, altLabel, narrower, broader, related and hasTopConcept are well suited to term and category relationships in things like WordNet or DBpedia or GeoNames or whatever, enabling both networked and hierarchical displays and retrievals of concepts. If you are not familiar with SKOS, the W3C site [2] is a great starting point; I also recommend the various use cases that are emerging from the effort [3]. I will shortly be releasing a discussion of an open community project called UMBEL, to be based on SKOS, that will also provide lightweight subject bindings for mapping and registering various KBs. More background will be forthcoming at that time. I hope, Tom, that I am not repeating what you already know, and I may not have all of the details absolutely correct because I'm still learning. In any event, since DBPedia is becoming the flagship for Linked Data, and many additional data sets are adding to it, I think it appropriate that SKOS leadership be shown as well. Just my opinion :) Mike [1] [2] [3] Tom Heath wrote: uJust for the record: dbpedia uses SKOS to represent the Wikipedia category system. Richard On 23 Jun 2007, at 18:59, Michael K.

I guess my concern/question is about whether we can say that a is of rdf:type , where is of rdf:type skos:Concept, which is what we'd end up with if we modelled YAGO in SKOS and then set rdf:type statements against these concept URIs. This just doesn't seem right to me because of SKOS's layer of indirection, unlike saying that skos:subject , where rdf:type skos:Concept, which seems fine. Just as FOAF is an ontology for describing things (mainly people), SKOS is an ontology for describing concepts. I think the SKOS Core Guide is useful in this context, in Open Issues->Relationship to RDFS/OWL Ontologies [1]: \"There is a subtle difference between SKOS Core and other RDF applications like FOAF [FOAF], in terms of what they allow you to model. SKOS Core allows you to model a set of concepts (essentially a set of meanings) as an RDF graph. Other RDF applications, such as FOAF, allow you to model things like people, organisations, places etc. as an RDF graph. Technically, SKOS Core introduces a layer of indirection into the modelling.\" \"This layer of indirection allows thesaurus-like data to be expressed as an RDF graph. The conceptual content of any thesaurus can of course be remodelled as an RDFS/OWL ontology. However, this remodelling work can be a major undertaking, particularly for large and/or informal thesauri. A SKOS Core representation of a thesaurus maps fairly directly onto the original data structures, and can therefore be created without expensive remodelling and analysis. \"SKOS Core is intended to provide both a stable encoding of thesaurus-like data within the RDF graph formalism, as well as a migration path for exploring the costs and benefits of moving from thesaurus-like to RDFS/OWL-like modelling formalisms.\" In this context, with YAGO being an ontology already, would it be a shame to not make use of the modelling capabilities of RDFS? I also note the bug logged at [2]: \"Do not use Wikipedia categories for rdf:types. The next version of the dataset should only use YAGO classes as rdf:types and shouldn't use Wikipedia categories any more\".

Well, I would have voted for underscores as that is consistent with our resource URIs, but Richard pointed that CamelCase is the way to go for classes. I like option 2, because it fits best with our goals I think. We want the DBpedia classes to be used within other datasets and to integrate these datasets. And integration is a lot easier if one classification is used. Otherwise we would have to interlink the different classification systems and that would also cause new problems. Cheers, Georgi uHi Georgi, all, On 24/06/07, Georgi Kobilarov < > wrote: Great :) Hopefully soon we can reach a final consensus, at which point both your script and ours can be modified accordingly. In addition to underscores we also have hyphens to deal with, in URIs such as: and (where the \"_lowercase\" has already been CamelCased). I'd suggest that we follow the same rule for dealing with hypens, such that we end up with: and What do people think about this? Hmm, I see the issue a little differently; something like this: \"many different people/organisations produce class hierarchies, such as Wordnet, YAGO, whatever. DBpedia can help these exist and be useful within a web of data by providing stable, dereferenceable URIs for the classes, using conventions that exist within the community (CamelCase, HTTP303 redirects etc). With a stable and reusable home, these class hierarchies can be used to enhance the DBpedia dataset (and others, e.g. Revyu, hence this thread ;) by providing things to link to in rdf:type statements, for example.\" So far I think we're in full agreement :) (Just for the record, I don't really care which classification they come from, I just want stable, (likely to be) widely used classes for saying that things on Revyu are of rdf:type pub, restaurant, film, tourist attraction, whatever; nothing more complex than that. This quite complex thread is simply a by-product (ByProduct? ;) of that desire). Regarding I have to (largely) disagree. Integration is a lot easier if one classification is used, but this depends on everyone agreeing to adopt the same classification (and on something meaningful and comprehensive and coherent having been produced). In my experience trying to reach this kind of agreement is the prelude to all manner of problems that are far worse than the challenges posed by trying to integrate data that uses different classifications. Integrating two classification schemes at certain points by defining mappings between specific classes is much more feasible than trying to integrate entire hierarchies. The Semantic Web provides us with an infrastructure for mapping between different ontologies and thereby integrating disparate data sets, so lets use it. Keeping DBpedia \"classification-agnostic\" strikes me as the most Web-like way to proceed. Trying to unify Yago, Wordnet, \"A.N.Other classification scheme\" with some DBpedia super-classification scheme sounds like a recipe for years of blood, sweat, and tears. :( Tom. uI completely agree with Tom on this point and I clearly favour having different classification schemata on top of DBpedia so that people can choose the schema that fits their needs best.

A subject like yours doesn't really tell anyone what your mail is about and most users will ignore it. In addition, using so many exclamation marks is generally frowned upon. We all have urgent questions. Now to your question - as I said before: Do NOT run the import launcher. You only need it to extract abstracts, which is very complicated. Don't try that now, you always do it later if you really want. In other words, you don't need a database or a MediaWiki instance. What do you want to extract? Please describe what you want to achieve. Maybe you're better off downloading some datasets with extracted data and get the data you need from them.

The positions are ideal for candidates who want to pursue their PhD, but could also be attractive to postdocs (the salary scale is the same and will be adjusted depending on prior work experience). See [1] for official details. The research project is a close cooperation between the research groups of Franz Baader (knowledge representation), Wolfgang Lehner (databases), and myself. Anybody who sees herself or himself at the intersection of knowledge representation, database theory, and practical data management is most welcome to apply. In particular, we are interested in ontology-based knowledge modelling on top of graph databases. English is our main language in daily communication, research, and teaching. TUD is one of the leading universities in Germany and has been identified by the German government as one of eleven \"Universities of Excellence\". Dresden is also a great place to live. Successful candidates could start almost immediately (from 1st July), but because of the very short time between final budget approval and project start, we are prepared to fill some positions only later. For the same reason, the application deadline on the job announcement is already very close [1]. However, if the positions cannot be filled in this short time, later applications will also be considered. I am happy to answer informal queries. Best regards, Markus [1] en"

"Ontological trouble with cities"	"uI just found another annoying \"feature\" of both dbpedia 3.4 and 3.5. Some cites, like this one have an rdf:type of \"dbpedia-owl:City\" as one would expect. On the other hand, there are a lot of major \"cities\" which don't have this type, such as infoboxes with useful information about these places. First I thought that a lot of the above \"cities\" aren't really \"Cities\" in the technical sense of the word, for instance, Tokyo and London are both composite entities that consist of multiple cities. (NYC really is a legal city, but the 5 boroughs are third-level administrative subdivisions!) But then I looked at some cities which aren't so ontologically challenged: \"Town Of\" Ithaca, like you often see in New York state) and found that these don't have an rdf:type of \"City\" either. The moral seems to be that the \"City\" type in dbpedia isn't all that useful currently. There is a type, however, in Freebase which is a bit more accurately assigned and roughly corresponds to \"Municipality\" in the dbpedia ontology. I was hoping to use the dbpedia ontology as the taxonomic skeleton for my next site, but now I'm left with the choice of 'bending' the dbpedia ontology (I don't feel bad asserting that Manchester is a dbpedia-owl:City but I do fret about \"Tokyo\" and \"London\") or creating my own taxonomy, which is a job I'll screw up as much as the next guy. Any thoughts?"

"Zotero, Wikipedia and Reference Citations"	"uTo All, I thought this announcement for Zotero's new support for Wikipedia was significant: Also, I have been meaning to recommend for some time the inclusion of Zotero sources as part of the Linking Open Data roadmap. This free Firefox plug-in has built-in support for most standard citation formats and can automatically extract citation information from hundreds of sources including WorldCat, CiteSeer, PubMed, Endnote, etc. A full list of the sources that Zotero extracts from may be found at: with support for these citation formats: For those of you who may not know, I have been a fan of Zotero for quite some time as an exemplar of practical user interfaces in a Firefox plug-in. While the system to date has been designed for researchers and professionals in the humanities and library sciences, I think their basic approach is easily extensible to any structured data, including RDF. Thanks, Mike BTW, by way of introduction, I am also cc'ing Dan Cohen and Josh Greenberg, two of the project leads on Zotero, with this email. Dan and Josh, I invite you to look at the mail archives of these two groups and to offer any commentary should you so choose. :) MKB uHi Michael, Thanks for make me discovering this wonderful tool! I just published a blog post that explains how Zotero could be integrated into the current Seamantic Web environment. Mr. Cohen and Mr. Greenberg: what do you think of that idea? If I refers to the development of the Semantic Radar add-on that implemented these two features (the open and the pinging) it hasn't been a big development cost and it gave a great tool to the semweb community to discover SIOC data and start creating new tools using this data. But the more interesting is certainly the fast that Zitgist would become a \"search-engine\"/\"citations-browser\"/\"citations provider\" for Zotero. Take care, Fred uHi again, Sorry but I forgot to include the link to my blog post, sorry: Salutations, Fred uHi Fred, Excellent write-up and thanks for seeing the value so quickly!

"Directly sampled importance score for DBpedia"	"uThe first draft of :SubjectiveEye3D (version 0.9) is now available at under a CC-BY-SA license. :SubjectiveEye3D contains data from DBpedia 3.9. :SubjectiveEye3D is a subjective importance score derived from Wikipedia usage data published in the industry standard N-Triples format. Concepts in the ?s field align with DBpedia concepts. We \"smush\" importance along redirects, so that a topic like :Justin_Bieber gets credit for all of the page views for all of the alternative renderings of his name. :SubjectiveEye3D is based on Wikipedia usage from 2008 to 2013 so it is has an unavoidable bias towards topics people have been interested in recently (for instance, the 2012 \"Avengers\" movie kicks the 1977 \"Star Wars\" movie to the curb.) However, inside that time period, interest has been normalized on a monthly basis to counteract the bias that would be caused by the increase in usage over time. :SubjectiveEye3D is almost certainly a better importance score than the \"gravity\" which was packaged with old versions of :BaseKB, but it is only available, at the moment, aligned to DBpedia. An alignment to :BaseKB is next, since the code used to create :SubjectiveEye3D can be easily modified to do vocabulary changes, such as mapping DBpedia to :BaseKB vocabulary and vice versa. The current version is limited to topics in the English Wikipedia, however, the source material is multilingual and by merging in the correct redirect and page id files it should be possible to produce a similar product for any other language.

If i try to remove the accents, i normally get a redirection page in the search results. I can then get the resource uri for this result and get the actual resource page. However, this only happens sometimes. For example, a region in France called IsÃ¨re has the following page: If i access the page without the accent, I am still redirected to the correct page. However, if I search for the plain string in the label, I don't get any results. Here is the query I am using: PREFIX dbpedia-owl: PREFIX rdfs: SELECT DISTINCT ?place WHERE { ?place a dbpedia-owl:PopulatedPlace . ?place rdfs:label ?label .

"Using DBPedia for Country Data"	"uHi all, I'm new to DBPedia and am working on a project that needs statistics about countries. DBPedia seems to be the perfect resource for this data as it's all there - I just seem to be having trouble getting at it! This query worked the other day but out of the blue has stopped working and I don't know why! The query gets all of the properties for a specific country all the associated values. Some of these properties are URIs and instead of returning these I just wanted a string of text associated with that URI. With this in mind the query is split into two parts, the first which finds all of the URIs and finds the label associated with it. The second part gets all of the properties that aren't URIs. I then union the two to retrieve everything I want. SELECT ?title ?value WHERE { { ?country ?prop ?uri. ?country a . ?country rdfs:label ?label. ?prop rdf:type rdf:Property. ?prop rdfs:label ?title. ?uri rdfs:label ?value. FILTER (lang(?value) = \"en\") } UNION { ?country ?prop ?value. ?country a . ?country rdfs:label ?label. ?prop rdf:type rdf:Property. ?prop rdfs:label ?title. } FILTER (?label = \"United States\"@en && !isURI(?value)) } Individually these work but the union, which worked a couple of days ago, appears to break it. For those who are interested the working prototype can be seen at If you have any ideas what I'm doing wrong any help would be appreciated!

Aaah, I see that the current public version of the program doesnât pull the data to the right place on the display (so you canât see it at the minute) but that should be fixed shortly. The issue is that I donât particularly want the URI itself, just the text. For now weâve got a work around which does the two queries and combines them our end which does the job so donât worry too much - itâd just be interesting to know why it doesnât work!

Although, it semms to be 'NICE' I register this as yor your opinion to my origin posting to Paul Thanks, baran Paul has a Virtuoso instance configured and deployed via an Amazon AMI in the AWS Cloud. Like the DBpedia SPARQL endpoint, when the Virtuoso RDBMS is up and running you can query data via SPARQL and/or SQL.

These queries generally don't work the triple server hard so they work just fine against the public SPARQL endpoint: For instance, this query will give you the types ordered by how many occurences there are of the types: select ?p ?o { ?p ?o . } gives you all the statements where the type appears on the left and select ?s ?p { ?s ?p . FILTER(?p!=rdf:type) } gives you all the statements on where the type appears on the right, omitting statements of the form \"?x a ?type.\" Diagraming the schema looks like a fun project, but the raw material to analyze the schema is all there.

SPARQL query result sets are almost indistinguisable from SQL result sets so you can take your whole bag of tricks from SQL to SPARQL. Any SQL <-> SPARQL translation runs into issues with cardinalities, that is, SQL aligns a single set of values for various properties across a row, so you have something like [ :personId 8831 ; :dateOfBirth \"1972-04-24\"^^xsd:date ; :firstName \"Sachin\" ; :lastName \"Tendulkar\" ; ] and for many properties the 1-1 association makes sense, but RDF standards do not enforce it. There might be multiple claims about any of these things, or maybe somebody changed their ::lastName from \"Lieber\" to \"Lee\", or their :gender from :Female to :Male, whatever. Then there are properties that are definitely multi-valued such as :wroteBook, :hadParent, etc. All of that can be modeled in SQL but the process of going from SPARQL to SQL could be lossy if you don't take the time to deal with all the problems that present themselves. (Or unless you do some trivial mapping such as as creating s,p,o columns) With SPARQL you can get the original data with complete fidelity without thinking about how the conversion works out. People who are comfortable with SQL might find that learning SPARQL is a shorter path to getting the results they want.

Would you please give me more information about how can I use this mapping for better classification in the above IE task? Describe the solution using \"Monty Python\" case. Thank you. Kind regards, Amir uDear Amir, Â  the task you wish to accomplish is a sense easier to do with the mapping and in some sense harder. The easier part is that the classification information is more accurate. Â  Â  E.g. for Monty Python my mapping contains the following statement: < Â  The obscure Cyc symbol is aÂ ComedyTeam (alas, the Semantic Web endpoint of Cyc is not working at the moment :( I checked it in my copy of OpenCyc). So this is precisely the type of Monty Python. In Cyc this generalizes toÂ MultiPersonAgent - something similar to organization. Â  So the easier part is that you have the precise data. But the hard part is that you have to learn Cyc (at least some basics).Â  Â  It is up to you to decide if you want to invest your time in learning Cyc or you are going to develop your own method of resolving the conflicts.

The Monty Python wikipedia articles is using the Infobox_comedian [1] which is defined also for Comedy groups. The problem is that the mapping [2] maps only to the Comedian class, while it should use a ConditionalMapping, as done for the Infobox_musical_artist [3] In order to fix this I think we should: 1) Create a ComedyGroup class, which is a rdfs:subClassOf Organisation 2) Add a ConditionalMapping in [1] that maps to ComedyGroup in case current_members or past_members is set I am going to do this is a while.

"Linking content from DBpedia to my content (was: Please Urgent Question Need answer)"	"uHi Abdullah, Excuse me for breaking into your discussion, but from what I understand, you don't need to extract anything from Wikipedia yourself. The DBpedia (Live) project have the abstracts of all Wikipedia articles; if you have a list of article titles you can just retrieve them from DBpedia. For example, if the topic/article on your list is \"Frisbee\", you use HTTP GET on , which returns RDF data about the concept . The abstract you're looking for is the object in the triple(s) conforming to the pattern dbpedia-owl:abstract [object] . (Frisbee redirects to Flying disc.) If your list is very very long, you'd better download a dump of all abstracts, load them in a triple store and use SPARQL to extract the abstracts you need, or perform your queries directly on the file using a SPARQL engine. I hope this answers your question. If the concepts on your list do not match any DBpedia resources directly, you will need to perform text searches on the abstracts (you can using SPARQL, to some degree, or perhaps the Lookup service) or perhaps even start to think of Topic Modelling, but IMHO other platforms are better suited to questions about these topics. StackOverflow, for example, has lots of question about using SPARQL with DBpedia. Good luck! Regards, Ben On 6 August 2013 19:19, Abdullah Nasser < > wrote:"

Iâm proud to announce the 1.0 release of Infovore, a complete RDF processing system * a Map/Reduce framework for processing RDF and related data * an application that converts a Freebase quad dump into standard-compliant RDF * an application which creates consistent subsets of Freebase, including compound value types, about subsets of topics that can be selected with SPARQL-based rules * a query-rewriting system that enforces a u.n.a island while allowing the use of multiple memorable and foreign keyed names in queries as does the MQL query engine * a whole-system test suite that confirms correct operation of the above with any triple store supporting the SPARQL protocol See the documentation here processing, making it possible, even easy, to handle billion-triple data sets on a computer with as little as 4GB of memory.

Maybe there is some rationale behind - classifying \"lists of persons\" as \"person\" but IMO this is misleading information for end-users looking for persons. A more appropriate type might be \"List of people\" or \"List of footballers\". Also, I wonder what is the provenance of this class? I believe its not from a infobox info but more from some machine learning algorithm. Is it possible to track the provenance? Moreover, it could be possible to filter-out such resources using the Wikipedia categories info, however, this info is not available for the lists. In Wikipedia there are 3 categories assigned for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Iranian_football_transfers_summer_2012 but non of them in the corresponding DBpedia resource http://dbpedia.org/page/List_of_Iranian_football_transfers_summer_2012 Any thoughts on this?

"flickr wrapper and image copyright ownership"	"uHello List, first: i think the flickr wrapper is a great idea, so thank you for coding this. the example[1] does not link back to the original flickr photo page and does not include the copyright information. while the flickr api tos[2] doesn't talk about that explicitly it's good habit[3] for flickr api users and mentioned in the community guidlines[4]: \"Do link back to Flickr when you post your photos elsewhere\". i can imagine some flickr users (including me) could be concerned about usage of their images in another context without telling about copyright ownership. imho[5] you have to tell people about the source if you use it (for free).

"a query with count returns different results from the same query without count"	"uHi I have just discovered that a query with count have a behaviour that is different from the same query without count.

OPTIONAL {?uri rdfs:label ?string.

"Kudos and basic statistics"	"uTo All, DBpedia is most impressive and deserves more attention than it's gotten to date (esp. viz Freebase). I've pretty well scoured the Web site, but still have a couple of naive questions: 1. Is there a reference to how the information extraction from Wikipedia actually occurs? 2. What is the (estimated) unique count for properties across the database (saw 8 K for the Infobox portion)? Are DBpedia's unique properties directly comparable to YAGO's unique relations (14)? 3. Across DBpedia, what is the (estimated) unique count of instances? Again, how does that relate to terms such as concepts, instances or facts? 4. I'm intrigued with what possibility this team sees for YAGO (or other approaches as well, frankly) to improve DBpedia's classification structure (and, by implication, what might be perceived as weak with the current approach)? I know that all of this goes well beyond a numbers game, but I have a hard time seeing how expressing \"size\" using triples really means anything other than the raw content that needs to be stored and indexed. Aren't relations/properties + entities/concepts/instances better ways of expressing actual information coverage? Sorry to be a pest. :) I'm trying to get up to speed on some of this stuff so I can help explain it better to others. And, again, great work! Thanks, Mike uHello Mike, Michael K. Bergman schrieb: We wrote a paper about the infobox extraction: However, DBPedia is more than that and as far as I know there exists no general overview of all used techniques so far (not surprising as it is a fairly new project). I am not completely sure, but I think the number (8K) should be approximately correct since most properties come from infoboxes. (I just mean the overall count of different properties. Of course properties like skos:broader or geonames:featureCode appear very frequently.) No. YAGO extracts properties from the Wikipedia categories and Wikipedia redirects. Naturally, this allows to extract only a small amount of different properties. For instance, Wikipedia categories allow to extract \"subclass of\" or \"born in year\" (from categories like 1920_births) relations. YAGO does not perform infobox extraction, which is the reason why their property count is relatively small. You can find more information at: For infoboxes these statistics can be found in the first paper above. There has been some interesting discussion with the YAGO people. I think their data could be a useful addition to DBPedia. They have extracted a classification hierarchy from Wikipedia combined with WordNet. DBPedia does not have a proper classification hierarchy yet, but we are working on extracting such a hierarchy from Wikipedia categories (the Wikipedia categories itself are not always compatible with rdfs:subClassOf). The other relations extracted by the YAGO algorithm are imho not present in DBPedia, so it would be interesting to combine the data sets. Jens uHi Mike, I would guess that we have around 1.6 million dbpedia instances in the dataset, plus around 100 000 references to instances within other datasets. Depends on your definition of the tree terms above. Using RDF-S terms: We have around 20 classes mostly people and geographic locations. Around 10 000 skos:Concepts derived from the Wikipedia category system. Around 1.6 million instances derived from individual articles of the English Wikipedia. Around 90 million facts, if you equal this term with RDF triple. Orri is working on a COUNT() extension for Virtuoso's SPARQL engine. When he is done, we will be able to provide proper statistics. Cheers Chris uThanks, all. The responses to my questions have been great. One quick follow-on: Can anyone tell me what the size (in MB) of the complete data files that can be downloaded from the Web site are unzipped? BTW, I should have something to post on this within the next day. Thanks, Mike Chris Bizer wrote: [snip] [snip]"
"Loading full DBpedia dataset, timings and approach"	"uHi, I'm trying to create a local mirror of DBpedia using Openlink Virtuoso open source edition and it seems to be taking a number of days to load the data. I've used the DBpedia load scripts previously submitted on the list by Hugh Williams (using ttlp_mt). I've so far managed to load : articlecategories_en.nt infobox_en.nt redirect_en.nt articles_label_en.nt infoboxproperties_en.nt shortabstract_en.nt disambiguation_en.nt longabstract_en.nt wikipage_en.nt externallinks_en.nt pagelinks_en.nt The load time seems to increase massively as files are loaded. I've used the virtuoso configuration settings from be adding the extra recommended indexes from This results in a 15Gb virtuoso db file which seems to take an inordinately long time to query. I was wondering if there are any recommended techniques for loading a full dataset e.g. are there any methods for partitioning of data to improve load and query times ? Could anyone else let me know how long their load times are for a full core dataset (or even just the en version) ? My server is a 2Gb, AMD Athlon BE-2400 (dual core) - Is this 'good' enough, should I invest in more memory ? Any suggestions would be really appreciated, Thanks, Rob uHi Rob, I might be wrong here or there might be some things that can be done better, but this is my experience with loading datasets in Virtuoso. My load took close to a day. If this is any indication that might be useful, my total Virtuoso db size came to 12Gb; I did not choose some of the datasets you loaded. I also only loaded the en set. From my own estimates I figure that a full load of multiple languages on my machine is going to take a *long* time. I got the same, almost exponentially increased load times the more datasets I loaded. The configuration settings (your first link) definitely improved the loading performance for me. My load would have gone on for a couple of days if those configuration settings were not used. By the way, I loaded mine onto a CoreDuo (1st-gen Intel) MacBook Pro, running at 2.16GHz, and with 2Gb of RAM  not too different from your specs. The hard disk on your server should run faster, and you'll probably get faster queries. Virtuoso runs very well for what I'm applying it for (an art project that requires simple SPARQL queries over the interval of 30 seconds or so). However, on top of running the Virtuoso server I'm also executing more CPU-intensive Java applets that send my cooling fans into a frenzy. I haven't had a chance to monitor CPU load yet but even with the extra load the queries perform satisfactorily. I'm calling the queries via POST methods from my Java app to the sparql endpoint. What kind of queries are you calling? Make sure you also include the default-graph-uri= all datasets in it's databases for the query. Hope this helps, Andrew On Apr 18, 2008, at 2:21 PM, robl wrote: uHi Guys, On the same topic, I have myself been using Allegro Graph to load dbpedia data sets with hardware 2.16 GhZ, 2GB RAM, single core, using a java client on a network.

I also loaded few other actual dbpedia datasets and been getting 4-5 minutes for the regex queries. Has anybody done any benchmarks on \"regex\" queries, since my suspicion is that they are making the querying slower.

So the German articles we use are basically a subset of the English articles. Since the coordinates data should be pretty much the same in all languages, this means that geo_de is basically a subset of geo_en, except where the English and German Wikipedia disagree about the coordinates of a place.

Check pedia.sztaki.hu \"Enable it in your account\". It communicates with a server endpoint which is provided by us and is totally public and free (but is in beta! Could not test it with crowd load yet). Behind that endpoint there are a couple of servers: UIMA, Solr(Lucene) and other stuff. That stuff is not a beast you just download and install, but you don't need it anyway. 2) Well, your second question is a harder one. What I can promise that we will come up with some general version you can use but with less functionality. -the categorization relies on Yahoo search. As long as yahoo indexes the Wiki of your preferred language we can make it work. (A long-term issue is that we have to pay a small amount for it - some 4$ / 10K search - I will try to find someone at yahoo and ask for their support for instance in exhange for putting their logo in the suggestion window. But right now I don't even have a contact to them.) -Link recommendation relies on tf-idf data and the dbpedia data. To do the tf-idf calculation we need the xml dump of a certain wiki and run some scripts. It takes about a week in case of the english wiki, others are of course much smaller BUT we need some kind of stemmer or lemmatizer to the given language - preferably one which we can integrate with UIMA. We already have integrated snowball, so in theory we are able to process any language snowball supports ( don't do the stemming, in theory tf-idf can still work but problems arise with languages like Hungarian - where we concatenate funky suffixes to the words to signal past tense, posessive, modalities, etc>From dbpedia we use the list of pages so its not optional. -Infobox recommendation is similar - it relies on the XML dump, and the corresponding dbpedia infobox data. If we have those we can start a kind of machine learning (actually done by lucene). To be able to display the infobox fill form with help, we also need certain xml files for infoboxes. -there is a co-occurence learning phase, it relies on XML dump and tf-idf, and is needed for book recommendation. But book search works without that. -Book recommendation is quite simple - you can use the english books, which are often referenced in non-english texts as well. To have non-english books we need library catalogs in some processable format. That can be an issue, I have not even found one for Hungarian yet. However, we could change this part and use library API's like Z39.50. There are always performance issues with those but I can see that sooner or later we need to support those. So to sum up, adding a new language is a piece of work right now and we need certain resources. However, we will try German and Hungarian in this year. We will try to simplify the process and will do our best in supporting more languages.  But we always gonna need some help form locals to the given country - library data and testing.

"Easier simple searches"	"uI think that it needs to be easier to perform free text searches on DBpedia. Obviously, for complex semantic queries, the various SPARQL query interfaces provide powerful tools, but finding the URIs of interest in the first place remains challenging. One way to do it is to use one of the SPARQL UIs (I like ) and use a query phrase such as `?topic rdfs:label \"your topic here\"@en .` For this reason, I think it would be useful if that form defaulted to having that phrase in the body, instead of an ellipsis. This approach has some obvious problems, however. (For example, you need to be careful about the choice of or absence of the language tag, you need to get the label exactly correct, and you need to know a bit about SPARQL.) As a result, I think there should be a more sophisticated free text entry search box, which could use a SPARQL extension or at the other extreme could query Wikipedia directly and then rewrite the result URIs to the \"corresponding\" DBpedia pages. In any case, I think the chosen solution needs to be prominently included on at least the DBpedia home page, and likely from *every* DBpedia page. I think this should be as simple as a \"Search:\" input (such as the one that Wikipedia provides on each page). Thank you for your consideration. Respectfully, John L. Clark uHi John, I agree with you that there's a need for a simple search interface. I had built such an UI with DBpedia Search [1]. The prototype is unfortunately not working at the moment due to backend problems, but its functionality is briefly explained in our DBpedia ISWC paper [2]. The DBpedia dataset can be used to create a end-user friendly Wikipedia search, as its strong semantics could potentially provide much better results than the current key-text based search engines. But I think at the moment it would be more important to have a URI finder for data publishers. There was a discussion-thread [3] on the Linking-Open-Data list about how such a service could look like. Could be describe your use-case for a search functionality in more detail? Who is the user (end-user or data publisher)? What is he looking for? Cheers, Georgi [1] [2] [3] 22478"

I can do this because i don't need the full path between the nodes but just a value that represents the distance (in this case i think i can call it \"semantic distance\"). Now, i don't know where to start from for doing this (my software is in java). Wich dump should i use? Anyone knows reliable opensource libraries for managing owl (i never used it before so i'm really new to it)?

One way would be to use SPARQL and query the official endpoint, e.g. using Jena [1]. The second way would be to use the OWL API [2]. What to do specifically, depends on your distance metric. For instance, you could ask yourself whether two classes A1 and A2 are similar in your scenario if A1 is a super class of A2.(?) A simple way would be to query parent classes of A1 until a class A' is found, which is also parent of A2. You then get a path from A1 to A2 with A' as middle element and can measure its length. Due to the existence of owl:Thing such a path always exists. Google comes up with a few papers with more sophisticated approaches related to measuring distance in ontologies [3,4,5], which might be helpful. In your description, you assume that there is one class for each object. In general, an object can be instance of several classes. In particular, it can also belong to several \"most specific\" classes. However, this does seem to be rare in the DBpedia ontology (and you can generalise the above description to this case).

This remembers me of leacock chodorow measure used in my research lab for calculating semantic distance in wordnet. The fact that there's a class wich is a kind of root is a good thing for this. There's something alse like that i should know? Or can you even suggest me something like a tool for visualizing the ontology and became aware of his characteristics? (in a university course we used protege for building example ontologies, could it be useful?) It's really funny that the second paper you're suggesting me has been done by researchers in the same laboratory of the same university i'm actually working in :) so i thank you for your suggestion and i will probably go ask them some suggestion about distance metrics. Ok i get it. Now for example let's take: (my home town). the rdf:type property (wich i'm assuming is the one useful for the maping) gives back: rdf:type dbpedia-owl:Place dbpedia-owl:Area dbpedia-owl:Resource dbpedia-owl:PopulatedPlace Googling yago i've found it's an ontology based on wordnet structer (more or less). By the way as you told me the classes are one more specific than another. Is there a way to determinate how \"deep\" a class is other than calculating a path to owl:Thing ? I'm asking this because right now i'm thinking of mapping an instance to one class, maybe the most specific one, by te way i may find come other ways like map to every class and than take the deepesti don't know i will have to think a bit more about this :) Thank you again. Regards, Piero uHello, Piero Molino schrieb: [] Yes, Protégé can be useful. If you open the DBpedia ontology in Protege, go to the OWLViz tab, then select \"Options\" => \"Radius 5\", you get an overview of all classes. If you meet Francesca Lisi or Nicola Fanizzi, send them my regards. :-) DBpedia has different class hierarchies (DBpedia ontology, YAGO, OpenCyc, Umbel), which you should not mix in your approach. See Section 3.2 in our latest DBpedia paper [2] for an overview. The DBpedia ontology has the prefix Since we currently store all types of an entity (Place, Area, PopulatedPlace) for an entity and not just the most specific one (PopulatedPlace), you could also calculate the depth by just counting the number of classes. This works if there is a single most specific class and we keep storing all more general classes in the SPARQL endpoint (which might change in the future). Kind regards, Jens uHi Jens, sorry for resuming this old discussion but I'm working on this right now (when I started the discussion it was in an evaluation state). Il giorno 17/lug/2009, alle ore 08.22, Jens Lehmann ha scritto: Analyzing the DBpedia ontology I've found that it is somehow \"lightweight\" in respect of the task i want to do on it. To calculate a semantic distance maybe YAGO fits better. Also it is based on the wordnet structure witch has been used in many projects as a resource for calculation of semantic distance. By the way the idea you gave me about calculating the distance counting the classes works in the DBpedia ontology because every class listed is a subclass of the other, but as i am observing from the example i posted before, in the YAGO ontlogy it is not like that. I would ask this question on a YAGO mailing list but i can't find any reference on this on their website so i a m sking here, i hope not o be out of contest. Another question: ad i want to have a \"general\" approach, i am finding some instances that are somehow different from the others as they don't have a rdf:type. For example: Assuming i'm calculating the semantic distance from owl:thing caounting the classes in rdf:type, this node would behave differently, so how could i do it in this cases?

"Diffrence between URI, URIref and namespace URI?"	"uWhat's the exact difference between a URI, a URIref and a namespace URI? Thank you! What&#39;s the exact difference between a URI, a URIref and a namespace URI?Â Thank you! u\"URI reference\" was another name for IRI. An IRI is basically a URI that may contain non-ASCII characters. See the (outdated) RDF 1.0 spec: If I'm not mistaken, the term \"URI reference\" was used in RDF 1.0 because the RFC for IRIs was not finished yet. RDF 1.1 only uses the term \"IRI\". A namespace URI - or more precisely namespace IRI - is the prefix shared by a certain set of RDF IRIs, e.g. \" \"Namespace IRIs and namespace prefixes are not a formal part of the RDF data model. They are merely a syntactic convenience for abbreviating IRIs.\" Hope that helps.

"questions about DBpedia ontology"	"uHi, I have a question about the DBpedia's ontology: 1. looks like DBpedia has its own high level ontology, which is newly created, and has about 170 classes defined, and about 900 properties; 2. also, DBpedia also uses the SKOS vocabulary, YAGO classification system. How do these two related to the ontology above? 3. how can I see one example of the RDF statements generated by parsing one specific infobox? that will give me a lot better understanding I am not even sure my questions are making sense, but I do look forward to any help/thoughts you can provide. thanks! uOn 28 Jan 2009, at 18:46, l Yu wrote: For example, here's an infobox: It's easy to obtain the corresponding DBpedia URI, just replace the prefix: Open that in your browser.

Best, Richard uThanks! this is very helpful. And regarding my question 1 and 2, I am still looking for answers. Let us make it more clear, maybe that will help. So basically we have this new ontology (dbpedia-ontology.owl), which has about 170 classes and 900 properties, and the parsing of the infobox is done by (mainly) using this ontology. And to understand the exact mapping from infobox to this ontology, using tennis player Roger Federer as an example (given Aussie Open is going on), I did the following query: PREFIX (skip) SELECT ?property ?hasValue WHERE { ?property ?hasValue. } which shows me how the parse has been done for the infobox on the page for Roger Federer: all the property that has ever been used on resource dbpedia-ontology.owl ontology is used when the parsing is being conducted, yet, there are indeed other vocabularies involved: 1. YAGO mainly used as the subject of rdf:type. for example: dbpedia:Roger_Federer rdf:type dbpedia:class/yago/LivingPeople 2. SKOS: mainly used as follows: dbpedia:Roger_Federer skos:subject :Category:1981_births So the question is: Seems to me that dbpedia-ontology.owl is good enough to do the trick (at this point), why do we need SKOS and YAGO? I don't see much reason. Could you please shed some light on this one?

Users of DBpedia can choose which part of the datasets work best for them. The three datasets you mention all have different strengths: The SKOS stuff directly corresponds to Wikipedia categories, the YAGO stuff is much more comprehensive than dbpedia-owl while still being closer to a true class hierarchy than the SKOS categories, and dbpedia-owl is very high quality and contains properties, not just a class hierarchy. Choice is a good thing, and if you don't need any of these bits for your task, then just don't use them.

My idea is to ask the DBpedia community to maintain the ontology and all mappings, but I haven't had the time to implement the according user interface yet. And the UI is not going to be trivial: It has to be easy enough to browse and maintain the ontology (which will - I think -contain hundreds of classes and over thousand properties in its end version), easy to create/maintain the mappings of infoboxes, and it will need to have a user role model and versioning, so that no-one will be able to \"break\" things. No rocket-science, but also still not something to implement on a weekend unfortunately. It will come, but I can't promise when. Cheers, Georgi uThank you Georgi for the explanation - and the whole idea is quite clear to us now. I agree with you: this detailed mapping has to be created and maintained somewhat manually, and once we have a new mapping done, we can run the extractor to get better RDF graphs. More specifically, two types of mappings have to be maintained: 1. class-level mapping each \"infobox template\" has to be mapped to some class defined in DBpedia ontology; this is the *relatively* easy part; 2. property-level mapping this is the one that requires patience and tons of work: map each property from a given infobox template to the properties of its corresponding class defined in the first mapping. Obviously, lots of work needs to be done.

"DBpedia-based RDF dumps for Wikidata"	"uDear all, TL;DR; We are working on an *experimental* Wikidata RDF export based on DBpedia and would like some feedback on our future directions. Disclaimer: this work is not related or affiliated with the official Wikidata RDF dumps. Our current approach is to use Wikidata like all other Wikipedia editions and apply our extractors to each Wikidata page (item). This approach generates triples in the DBpedia domain ( duplication, since Wikidata already provides RDF, we made some different design choices and map wikidata data directly into the DBpedia ontology. sample data: experimental dump: (errors see below) *Wikidata mapping details* In the same way we use mappings.dbpedia.org to define mappings from Wikipedia templates to the DBpedia ontology, we define transformation mappings from Wikidata properties to RDF triples in the DBpedia ontology. At the moment we provide two types of Wikidata property mappings: a) through the mappings wiki in the form of equivalent classes or properties e.g. property: Class: which will result in the following triples: wd:Qx a dbo:Person wd:Qx dbo:birthDate ââ b) transformation mappings that are (for now) defined in a json file [1]. At the moment we provide the following mappings options: - Predefined values - \"P625\": {\"rdf:type\":\" will result in: wd:Qx a geo:SpatialThing - Value formatting with a string containing $1 - \"P214\": {\"owl:sameAs\": \" will result in: wd:Qx owl:sameAs - Value formatting with predefined functions. The following are supported for now - $getDBpediaClass: returns the equivalent DBpedia class for a Wikidata item (using the mappings wiki) - $getLatitude, $getLongitude & $getGeoRss: geo-related functions Also note that we can define multiple mappings per property to get the Wikidata data closer to the DBpedia RDF exports e.g.: \"P625\": [ {\"rdf:type\":\"http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing\"}, {\"geo:lat\":\"$getLatitude\"}, {\"geo:long\": \"$getLongitude\"}, {\"georss:point\":\"$getGeoRss\"}], \"P18\": [ {\"thumbnail\":\" http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/$1?width=300\"}, {\"foaf:depiction\":\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/$1\"}], *Qualifiers & reification* Like Wikidata we provide a simplified dump without qualifiers and a reified dump with qualifiers. However, for the reification we chose simple RDF reification in order to reuse the DBpedia ontology as much as possible. The reified dumps are also mapped using the same configuration. *Labels, descriptions, aliases and interwiki links* We additionally defined extractors to get data other than statements. For textual data we split the dumps to the languages that are enabled in the mappings wiki and all the rest. We extract aliases, labels, descriptions, site links. For interwiki links we provide links between Wikidata and DBpedia as well as links between different DBpedia language editions. *Properties* We also fully extract wikidata property pages. However, for now we donât apply any mappings to wikidata properties. *DBpedia extractors* Some existing DBpedia extractors also apply in Wikidata that provide versioning and provenance (e.g. pageID, revisionID, etc) *Help & Feedback* Although this is a work in progress we wanted to announce it early and get you feedback on the following: - Are we going in the right direction? - Did we overlook something or is something missing? - Are there any other mapping options we should include? - Where should we host the advanced json mappings? - One option is in the mappings wiki, another one is in Wikidata directly or a separate github project It would be great if you could help us map more data. The easiest way is through the mappings wiki where you can define equivalent classes & properties. See what is missing here: http://mappings.dbpedia.org/server/ontology/wikidata/missing/ You can also provide json configuration but until the code is merged it will not be easy with PRs. Until the code is merged in the main DBpedia repo you can check it out from here: https://github.com/alismayilov/extraction-framework/tree/wikidataAllCommits Notes: - we use the Wikidata-Toolkit for reading the json structure which is a great project btw - The full dump we provide is not complete due to a Wikidata dump export bug.

To map all data on the web to the DBpedia ontology is a huge undertaking that will take many years of effort. However, if it can be accomplished the potential payoff is also huge and could result in the realization of a true Semantic Web. Just as with any very large and complex software development effort, there needs to be a structured approach to achieving the desired results. That structured approach probably involves a clear requirements analysis and resulting requirements documentation. It also requires a design document and an implementation document, as well as risk assessment and risk mitigation. While there is no bigger believer in the \"build a little, test a little\" rapid prototyping approach to development, I don't think that is appropriate for a project of this size and complexity. Also, the size and complexity also suggest the final product will likely be beyond the scope of any individual to fully comprehend the overall ontological structure. Therefore, a reasonable approach might be to break the effort into smaller, comprehensible segments. Since this is a large ontology development effort, segmenting the ontology into domains of interest and creating working groups to focus on each domain might be a workable approach. There would also need to be a working group that focus on the top levels of the ontology and monitors the domain working groups to ensure overall compatibility and reduce the likelihood of duplicate or overlapping concepts in the upper levels of the ontology and treats universal concepts such as space and time consistently. There also needs to be a clear, and hopefully simple, approach to mapping data on the web to the DBpedia ontology that will accommodate both large data developers and web site developers. It would be wonderful to see the worldwide web community get behind such an initiative and make rapid progress in realizing this commendable goal. However, just as special interests defeated the goal of having a universal software development approach (Ada), I fear the same sorts of special interests will likely result in a continuation of the current myriad development efforts. I understand the \"one size doesn't fit all\" arguments, but I also think \"one size could fit a whole lot\" could be the case here.

If the opening sentence had said \"based on the DBpedia ontology,\" I probably would have figured it out. Your amplification of the underlying motivation helps me better understand what's driving this though.

Iâm very interested in this. A simple example: bgwiki started keeping Place Hierarchy in Wikidata because itâs much less efficient to keep it in deeply nested subtemplates. This made it very hard for bgdbpedia to extract this info, because how do you mix e.g. dbo:partOf and wd:Pnnn? So this is a logical continuation of the first step, which was for DBpedia to source inter-language links (owl:sameAs) from WD. (I havenât tracked the list in a while, could someone give me a link to such dump? Sorry) Tom Morris> abandoned critical thinking and assumed DBpedia was dead now that we had WikiData Thatâs quite false. Both have their strengths and weaknesses. - DBpedia has much more info than Wikidata. For Chrissake, Wikidata doesnât even have category>article assignments! - Wikidata has more entities (true, \"stubs\"), a lot of them created for coreferencing (authority control) purposes. IMHO thereâs a bit of a revolution in this domain, check out VIAF is moving to Wikidata coreferencing, which will get them double the name forms, 300k orgs and 700k persons. This is Big Deal to any library of museum hack. - Wikidata has easier access to labels. In DBpedia you have to do a wikiPageRedirects dance, and if youâre naÃ¯ve youâll assume âGod Does Not Play Diceâ is another name for Einstein - Right now IMHO Wikidata has better direct types for persons. This is a shame and we need to fix it in DBpedia We exactly have to think about this. Last few months I've been worrying that the two communities don't much talk to each other. We as humanity should leverage the strengths of both, to gain maximum benefits. I've become active in both communities, and I feel no shame in such split loyalies. :-) I went to DBpedia Dublin, now'll go to GlamWiki Hague It's structured data each way! Some little incoherencies: - The DBpedia Extraction framework is a very ingenious thing, and the devs working on it are very smart. But can they compete with a thousand Wikidata bot writers? (plus Magnus who in my mind holds semi-God status) - Meanwhile, DBpedia can't muster a willing Wikipedia hack to service mappings.dbpedia.org, which is stuck in the stone age. - Wikidatians move around tons of data every day, but their understanding of RDF *as a community* is still a bit naÃ¯ve. - DBpedia holds tons of structured data, but Wikidata seems to plan to source it by individual bot contributionsmaybe in full in 5 years time? - DBpedia has grokked the black magic of dealing with hand-written *multilingual* units and conversions. Of a gazillion units Last I looked, Wikidata folks shrugged this off with \"too different from our data types\" - A Little Cooperation Goes a Long Way.

(Disclaimer: this work is not related or affiliated with the official Wikidata RDF dumps) We provide: * sample data for preview * a complete dump with over 1 Billion triples: * a SPARQL endpoint: * a Linked Data interface: Using the wikidata dump from March we were able to retrieve more that 1B triples, 8.5M typed things according to the DBpedia ontology along with 48M transitive types, 6.4M coordinates and 1.5M depictions. A complete report for this effort can be found here: The extraction code is now fully integrated in the DBpedia Information Extraction Framework.

With the mapping process we map Wikidata properties & classes to the DBpedia ontology and transform the statements accordingly. For instance wdt:Q42 wkd:P31 Q5 ; wkd:P569 \"11-03-1951\"^^xsd:date. will be transformed to dbw:Q42 rdf:type dbo:Person; # plus all transitive types from the DBpedia ontology dbo:birthDate \"11-03-1951\"^^xsd:date. If your point is to include missing Wikidata statements from DBpedia, this can be a step towards towards this goal since now it is easy to compare the differences. Best, Dimitris uThank you Hugh, This is definitely an area where we need further feedback from the community. Most of these links are DBpedia language links. The majority of the DBpedia links are not dereferencable and are based on the different DBpedia language editions provided as RDF dumps only. In this release we decided to provide them all for completeness but we are very open to other suggestions. Best, Dimitris On May 26, 2015 18:20, \"Hugh Glaser\" < > wrote:"

"Extracting Date Information"	"uHello Everyone, First off, I want to apologize in advance for any obvious questions I may ask. I'm new to this list and new to dbpedia (and to rdf, sparql, etc etc). I've been playing around with using the dbpedia data set to extract date information about historical events. The query that I'm running through snorql is: SELECT ?x ?y WHERE { ?x dbpedia2:date ?y FILTER regex(str(?x), \"Battle\") } LIMIT 50 This returns results quickly, but the vast majority of the date information is: \"&ndash;\"@en Looking through the source on wikipedia it seems that many dates are structured like: date=[[September 12]] &ndash; [[September 15]], [[1814]] which creates hyperlinked date information. I'm guessing that the dbpedia extraction algorithm ignores the hyperlinked data and just pulls out the &ndash;? My question is: can this data be pulled out in any other way or extracted in full the next time the dbpedia data set is updated? uHi Steven, And welcome to the list :) You've spotted a bug, or kind of a bug. Our infobox extraction algorithm supports the extraction of dates (see e.g. the \"date\" property in doesn't seem to) support time spans (e.g. in Battle_of_Baltimore). my question @all: How to best represent timespans in RDF?

Are you reliant on using the JSON (i.e. consuming it immediately in a Javascript application) or are you using a general purpose RDF/Semantic Web API? If you are doing the latter then it may be easier and more efficient to just pull back the RDF/XML or Turtle representation of the data and transform it to JSON on your end.

As with the previous releases, it is planned that Christopher runs all extractors for all languages. The resulting dumps will be provided for download via the DBpedia download page ( DBpedia SPARQL endpoint. We hope to be able to publish the new release end of July or early August. As a lot of additional infobox-to-ontology mappings for various languages have already been entered by the mapping editors community into the DBpedia Mapping Wiki ( release, we hope to be able to provide clean data for even more infoboxes in even more languages with the new release. With this email, I would also like to ask all members of the mapping editors community for their help with the upcoming DBpedia 3.9 release in the form of a Mapping Spring: 1. Could you please check whether the mappings that you have entered into the wiki over the last year still work correctly? 2. If you still want to refine and extend mappings, now would be the perfect time to do so. 3. In order to help increasing the infobox coverage of the new release, it would also be great if you map additional templates or additional properties of existing templates to the ontology. For helping you see which widely used templates still require additional property mappings, Christopher has updated the Mapping Wiki statistics for all languages: For the English Wikipedia edition, we can see for instance at that we can still get much better with infoboxes like \"Infobox ship characteristics\" or \"Infobox football club\" or \"Chembox\" amongst a lot of others :-) The statistics for German, Spanish and French are found below and also still show lots of gaps for these important languages: Christopher will use all mappings that are entered into the Mapping Wiki until June 30th for the new release. It would thus be great if as many editors as possible participate in the mapping sprint and we as a community try to increase the mapping coverage as far as possible until this date. Lots of thanks already in advance to all mapping editors who participate. Let's try to make the DBpedia 3.9 Release even better than the 3.8 Release! Cheers, Chris uThat's really cool! Thanks for letting us know. Would it be possible to pre-populate template mapping page on the wiki when hitting \"create\" with a skeleton containing current template properties? That would ease a bit the mapping effort IMHO. What do you think? Cheers Andrea 2013/6/13 Christian Bizer < >"

What could explain that some Wikipedia pages are left off the extraction process? This page, in particular, is a bit odd: it has been in existence since 2010, and has a very detailed infobox. On that note, I was wondering if the DBpedia team ever considered using persistent URIs for DBpedia terms - we are using DBpedia to tag programmes at the BBC, and the fluctuation in DBpedia URIs is very hard to deal with. There are persistent identifiers accessible through the Wikipedia API that would be much more useful for keying DBpedia URIs than ever-changing URL slugs.

"SKOS property in DBPedia"	"uHi Richard, It seems very strange for me to relate a DBPedia resource and its category by skos:subject. Although its rdfs:domain is not defined, I think skos:subject (and its super property dc:subject) is normally used to relate a (creative) work and its subject, not a concept and other concept, nor such real world thing as a person and a concept. How do you think ? 08/01/24 Richard Cyganiak< > uOn 24 Jan 2008, at 03:16, KANZAKI Masahide wrote: I agree that the most typical use of skos:subject is to relate creative works and concepts. We decided early on to model the Wikipedia category system using SKOS, and I think it's a very good match. The only problem was: What property to use for indexing DBpedia resources into their respective categories? We couldn't find any indication in the SKOS documentation that skos:subject should be used *only* for creative works. I also asked on the SKOS list if this was okay, and the consensus seemed to be that it's a bit strange, but not illegal. So we went with skos:subject. Maybe there is a better choice? Do you have a suggestion for another, more appropriate property to use in place of skos:subject? Cheers, Richard u2008/1/24, Richard Cyganiak: Well, there is no domain restriction for skos:subject, so it's 'legal' to relate anything and skos:Concept with skos:subject, but sometimes inappropriate. Let's think the following statement: dbpedia:Tim_Berners-Lee skos:subject dbpedia:Category:Living_people . I don't think it's good idea to say that \"TimBL's subject (or topic) is Living_people\" although we can say that \"TimBL is categorized as Living_people\". A person can be a subject of some works, and a person may be interested in some topics, but I can't imagine that a person has a subject or a topic I've tried similar approach that used Wikipedia as PSI of a subject, and used Wikipedia category as basis to categorize these subjects. Since I couldn't find appropriate terms for this purpose, I defined own vocabulary to describe them. can be used to relate DBPedia resource and its category, though the vocabulary is not well known (so far ;-). Or, since DBPedia already defined many terms for own project, it'd be no problem to define one more property for category relationship. best regards, uHmmm, re-reading some of the SKOS docs I get the feeling that skos:subject is indeed appropriate only for documents: | These properties [including skos:subject] can be used for subject | indexing of information resources on the web. Here 'subject indexing' | means the same as 'indexing' as defined by Willpower Glossary. The Willpower Glossary says: | indexing: intellectual analysis of the subject matter of a document | to identify the concepts represented in it, and allocation of the | corresponding preferred terms to allow the information to be retrieved So, skos:subject is intended for use on information resources, that is, documents. DBpedia resources in general are not documents. I'm logging this as a bug in the tracker. I think that a new property in the DBpedia namespace is perhaps the simplest solution, e.g. dbpedia:category. Thoughts anyone? Richard On 24 Jan 2008, at 11:06, KANZAKI Masahide wrote: uHi Richard, What is a category for DBPedia? Answering to this question will tell you if it is the good thing to do or not. If one is answering that it is a Wikipedia Category, then I will answer that it is not the good thing to do in my opinion. If one ask me why? I would answer that it is become many of the wikipedia categories are classes and in such a case why not defining them as a Class, and not a \"category\" (that could be considered a class for some sense of that class)? What if a category is not a class but something else? It is where the cleaning process is starting :) Take care, Fred uHi Fred 2008/1/24, Frederick Giasson : Wikipedia category is a classification, but not a Class in RDF/OWL sense (in most cases). For example, a category 'Internet_history' (taken from Tim Berners-Lee example) has 'Internet' as its super category. It's maybe OK as classification, but doesn't work as Classes, because 'Internet_history' cannot be a subClassOf 'Internet' (perhaps subClassOf 'History'). There are such categories as 'Tokyo', which could be used as labes of classification, but not even Concepts (or think it like 'Tokyo as concept' ? sounds tricky). I do support to use wikipedia concepts for useful information. Just concern how they should be related to DBPedia resources. best, uFred, On 24 Jan 2008, at 13:31, Frederick Giasson wrote: No. The Wikipedia category system is simply not appropriate as a class hierarchy. That's not a bug; it serves its purpose well, and the Wikipedia community likes it that way. It is essentially a tagging system, where tags themselves can be tagged. See [1] for an in-depth analysis. SKOS is an appropriate vocabulary for modelling the Wikipedia category system. RDFS is not. Hence, we do need a property for indexing arbitrary non-document resources into skos:Concepts. (By the way: Yes, class hierarchies can be created from the Wikipedia category system, e.g. by using cleanup heuristics and combining it with other data sources such as WordNet. Research on this is ongoing in the DBpedia project and elsewhere.) Richard [1] uHi Masahide, You just hit the nail :) You said it: in most cases. In fact, Wikipedia categories can be many things: named entities, concepts, relations, (something else?) So, why defining all wikipedia \"categories\" as \"categories\" (classification purposes) when it is *clearly* not the case? In my point of view, it just make things worse. In case of ambiguity, discard them, don't pollute the dataset with false assertions. In would encourage, everyone on that list, to read and re-read the work of Fabian on Yago: I think this would be a relation. Tricky, but it just found the gray area between a \"subject concept\" and a \"named entity\" I think. What is a \"Wikipedia concept\"? I mean, is it different from a \"concept\"? How they should be related to DBPEdia resources? With great care. Take care, Fred uHi Richard, Sure, but we are talking about the use of wikipedia categories in dbpedia; I am not questionning the use of categories in WIkipedia. RDFS is not in some case, but it is in some other. Exactly what I am talking about. And as I said in my reply to Masahide: should be handled with grat care. Many others? For sure, there are more than 50 papers that talk about that :) In multiple research groups around the globe. The only thing I say is that it is neither black or white, but there are much gray in there. And putting everything in the same bag doesn't help making it more useful. Take care, Fred uHi Richard See also the other thread about deprecation of skos:subject (I suggest to close the current thread and follow-up on that one to avoid parallel discussions) Richard Cyganiak a écrit : Indeed, but the genral notion of resource has evolved in the history of the Web from documents to more and more abstract resources. As you know, I belong to people who consider that there is a continuum from physical documents to abstract concepts, and any distinct limit between \"document\", \"information resource\", \"named entity\", \"concept\" is arbitrary. So, if we want to avoid endless discussions about that, let's assume that Everything is a resource Everything (including concepts themselves) can be indexed by concepts in order to be retrieved A generic mechanism for that should encompass all resources Indexing writers, musicians, buildings by art style, towns and countries by used languages or religions, restaurants by food type etc make sense whenever this is intended to retrieve those resources, not to declare classes and attributes. So, using skos:subject for grouping and retrieving DBpedia resources by Wikipedia categories makes perfect sense to me. That said, I agree the example pointed out by Masahide can seem weird. dbpedia:Tim_Berners-Lee skos:subject dbpedia:Category:Living_people but, as said in the other thread, not because of the use of skos:subject, but because of the strangeness of the Wikipedia category \"Living people\", which unfortunately tends to be not very reliable, and subject to permanent modification That said, it is perfectly functional : it supports queries retrieving all people indexed in this category. And you don't ask more to such a declaration. See above. Don't put your foot on this slippery slope > I'm logging this as a bug in the tracker. I think that a new property Well, I don't think it's a good idea. How will you federate this property with other indexing pointers? You got some :-) Cheers Bernard uOn 24 Jan 2008, at 14:09, Frederick Giasson wrote: They certainly all are skos:Concepts.

The Wikipedia category system is a concept scheme, in the SKOS sense. There are no named entities, or relations in a concept scheme. The category \"Berlin\" is still a concept. It might have a corresponding named entity somewhere, but that's another story. The named entity is not part of the concept scheme. Richard uHi Richard, My last answer to that thread since it could evolves that way for years :) It is all about definitions and our views of these things It is what I was saying: a Wikipedia Category can be: a named entity (Elvis), a concept, a relation, and possibly other things. So it is why I was making sure that all these three things where concepts for you (because you said *all*). However it seems clear now that it is not (at my standpoint, and at yours). Totally agree that Berlin is both a named entity and a concept. It is part of the gray area between concepts and named entities. Take care, Fred uFrederick Giasson wrote:"

I have a journal paper in ACM and a conference paper in WORLDCOMP. As per my university policy, I am required to have at least two research papers in peer-reviewed (refereed) international conferences or journals before I submit my synopsis/dissertation. While everything was fine, recently, WORLDCOMP was declared as a bogus conference with evidences and endorsements from scientists: Now, my university officials have stopped me from submitting the dissertation stating that WORLDCOMP is not peer-reviewed due to the evidences in these websites. They said that WORLDCOMP is completely fake and thatâs why you have not responded to the open challenge at om others. Now I am shocked with your silence. I am clueless on what to do as I will forfeit my student status unless I submit the dissertation soon. I am facing humiliation here. I was attracted by the keynote speakers, sponsors, tutorials, and University of Georgia name at WORLDCOMP website. Now I feel that I made a very critical mistake by submitting to WORLDCOMP. As the last resort, I am posting to this mailing list/forum (where WORLDCOMP details were published in the past I think) so that you understand the seriousness. I once again ask you to provide a detailed response at WORLDCOMPâs website and prove that it is not a fake (and also email me my paper reviews). I request you to focus on this issue than organizing the next conference (and create more victims like me). I hope you still have moral values. My elderly parents are dependent on me and I am crying for help. I openly beg your response! Respectfully, Saidi (this is my nickname and I am using it to avoid further humiliation. I know that you will easily identify me from this nickname and from my background mentioned above).

"how often is dbpedia live updated"	"uHi I made a change to a mapping days ago, how soon can I expect to see this change on live?

The data that you see at comes from the current DBpedia release which is version 3.6. The next release is scheduled for August. All the changes that were made in the mappings wiki will be included. However, since DBpedia is all open data and open source, you could also get the extraction framework [1] and extract the data yourself whenever you like. Lastly, DBpedia Live is currently in development and will feature updated data within short periods of time.

In our new DBpedia-Live framework, we take into consideration updates caused by both Wikipedia article change, and updates caused by a mapping change. But changes caused by Wikipedia article change have higher priority, in order for our live-update stream to work smoothly and with no blocks. So it, takes only few minutes to see changes caused by Wikipedia, whether changes caused by mappings may take longer, depending on how many Wikipedia changes are waiting for processing. We have also deployed our new DBpedia-Live framework, and you can test it and send us your feedback about it, and any suggestion will be highly appreciated. You can test our SPARQL endpoint at At the moment there are some Internet connection problems at our university, but they will be solved very soon, so you may experience some inconvenience with our server those days.

"Virtuoso/DBpedia VAD missing data from .rdf files"	"uHi, I've noticed that the with the RDF/XML description of the resources are missing a big portion of the data displayed on the site. For example look at literals and possibly other information from the .rdf file. The strange thing about this bug is that it seems to be valid only for entities of type place and subclasses of it. Entities of type person or chemical elements seem to be ok, however I haven't checked all of dbpedia and all of the properties so I can't estimate how wide-spread this issue is. Kind Regards, Alexandru Todor uHi, This is something I had to work around a while ago, so I think I know the answer, but correct me if I'm wrong. The RDF XML, JSON and N3 representations return mostly triples in which the resource can be found as an object. Actually, JSON and N3 does not even contain triples where the resource is a subject, while in RDF XML in some cases it does. The problem is that unlike the NTRIPLES, ATOM and JSOD representations, these 3 contain the resource as objects as well and in some cases this leads to lots of triples but there is a limit of 2000 for the number of returned triples. Places as you said are a good example: there are so many triples containing places that it's easy for them to reach 2000 triples while persons do not have as many. If you want to obtain the triples in which the URI is a subject, I would suggest you use the NTRIPLES representation (it also contains language data for the labels unlike rdf xml, json, n3, jsod).

Thanks, Lushan uHi Lushan, Thanks for reporting the issue. You can try to find the answer by comparing the versions of the Wikipedia page as of 3.6 release and as of 3.7 release. The exact date is on the mapping wiki. If the infobox changed, this could explain the difference, and adjusting the mapping on the mapping wiki would likely fix it. I have also observed that multiple values in a infobox property within a page can be tricky to extract (e.g. if a link or image was added beside the value). So you can look for that also.

Anyway, doing that, I ran into one of those amusing anomalies in how wikipedia/dbpedia is built. I found some shapes that appear to be named after three-letter IOC codes for countries, so Germany is \"GER\" instead of the iso digraph \"DE\". No problem, but this kind of thing that means there's no rest for the wicked. Anyway, I've got country names, so I'm probably just going to string match 95% of the names and do the weirdos by hand, but it got me to thinking that \"IOC country code\" is a property of a country. These are represented in that list, but there's the obnoxious thing that these don't link to the countries, but instead link to pages like The IOC code is infoboxed, which is good, but there's no reliable link back to the country. Most of these pages have a wikilink that points to the actual country, but often they have links to other countries too, for instance, Ghana points back to Now, it turns out that Ghana's infoboxes point to some pages that have some really rich information Unfortunately, at the moment, dbpedia only knows these as wikilinks.

"SKOS, Eponymous Categories, and Main Articles"	"uHi, I'm a graduate student working on a research project using Wikipedia's categorization system. I stumbled on to DBpedia while trying to discover the best way to access this data and have been plunging myself in to the wonderful world of the Semantic Web, RDF, SPARQL, DBpedia, and the inner workings of Wikipedia ever since. First, thanks for such a wonderfully structured access point to this information! Second, in the application I'm developing I'd like to combine 2 (or more, potentially) resources into one idea. For example, the article \"Pasta\" and category \"Category:Pasta\" both describe (roughly) the same idea. Right now I'm just matching labels. This becomes a problem, though, when the resources don't have the same name. Pluralization is one of the largest differences (e.g. \"Sandwich\" vs. \"Category:Sandwiches\"), but there are many cases that can't be fixed by a simple pluralization change. Wikipedia, though, has a system for manually denoting these \"eponymous categories\" and assigning main articles to categories. For example, see Wikipedia's category page for Pasta [1]. At the top we are given a link to the \"main article for this category\". At the beginning of the list of pages in the category we see \"List of Pasta\" and under the * we see the articles \"Pasta\" and \"Noodles\". The systems for denoting these connections are described in detail at [2], [3], and [4]. This information, however, is not present in DBpedia. I feel like this would be a valuable addition to the category information already available, but I don't want to pretend to know how to go about extracting this information or how to denote it (some SKOS predicate maybe?). Does anyone else think this would be useful information? Anyone super familiar with the current extraction framework and would know how doable this is or why it hasn't been done before? I know I won't be able to work it into my project (deadlines) but this project has exposed me to so many new ideas and technologies that I now feel invested in them all.

It even skips the instrument, background and genre fields from the third infobox (Musical artist). Gerard Kuys has remarked that DBpedia picks only one leaf class \"to avoid contradictions\". I can understand that various infoboxes scattered throughout the article could contribute non-sensical classes, especially if they have non-sense mappings as described here: However: - The above two \"modules\" are not randomly scattered, they are embedded in the main infobox template - How is \"contradiction\" defined\"?

I think shorter depth paths than the maximum specified should *also* be shown in the results, and likely be presented first 3. This example shows why ongoing means for structure clean up will be needed. Virtually every one of my queries connected through the United_States as a location. I suspect quite a few shared relations may prove to be either too broad or too narrow for real utility. But, what can/should be the mechanism to identify and exclude them? 4. Similarly, it would be nice if the interface handled/replaced the underscoring of terms. But these are quibbles, and do not detract in any way from how useful such a query format is. :) I also really like the field auto-completion, which is really important with no a priori knowledge of the objects in Wikipedia. Thanks! Mike Jens Lehmann wrote: uJens, Well donethis is another great way to meaningfully view the dataset. I especially like being able to click on the connections to get the full infobox that yielded the connection. It's an important piece of letting the user assess the origins of the connections, which I think librarians and folks in higher education will value greatly. Picking up on Mike's third point uHello Michael, Michael K. Bergman schrieb: Jörg ist reading the list as well. I am glad that the relationship finder passed your tests. :-) We will have a look as to why this happens. There is still a small bug in the search, which we will fix. However, the shortest paths should always be shown. Sometimes one thinks that there should be a shorter path through the data, but in fact there isn't. This is often the case for objects, which do not have Infoboxes in Wikipedia (or do not have one particular attribute, which might be interesting). Do you have a concrete example where the shortest path is not shown? We thought of not completely excluding such things, but let the user say which objects/properties should be ignored for a concrete query. However, this requires some technical and user-interface changes, which need some time to be implemented. So we decided to release without this functionality and add it afterwards. We will use/generate nice labels everywhere to get rid of underscores, %C2 etc. It is also nice if you just want to play with the data by more or less randomly entering some letters. :-) Jens uHello, Patrick Gosetti-Murray-John schrieb: Thanks. I also saw your Blog entry [*]. :-) uTo Jens and JÃ¶rg et al, I think what you have produced here is a new user interface exemplar, one of likely more to emerge as new ways are discovered to explore and exploit RDF graph data. I would like to suggest the two of you, as authors, post this to the linking-open-data group as well. (I would do so, but you're the innovators and I don't want to be presumptuous! :) ) It seems to me that a new ESW wiki section covering user interface and query alternatives could be a great resource to developers and data publishers moving forward. This linkage diagram is certainly one of those alternatives, joining network graph, conventional graphs, tabular, triples, timelines, maps, resource records (a la ZoomInfo), etc. Again, nice work, and I think discussions such as this, plus new tweaks and tests of the paradigm, will naturally evolve to the best combination of functionality and interface.

"All birds are pink"	"uHi all I was giving tonight a first lesson of SPARQL to my son, who is both a Wikipedia addict and bird watcher. Starting from winter visitor in our garden) to figure a few properties to use in a simple query, we remarked the 'p:color pink', a bit approximative for the Hawfinch. Checking the Wikipedia page, we found no obvious explicit mention of this pink color, neither in the infobox content, nor in the article text. Curious, we tried to found out other values of p:color for birds through the following query. PREFIX p: PREFIX dbpedia: SELECT DISTINCT ?c WHERE { ?x p:classis dbpedia:bird. ?x p:color ?c. } Well, we got three values 'pink', 'Pink', or 'none'. What did that mean? All birds in Wikipedia are pink or without color? Or some fanatic of pink has spammed the birds articles? So we checked again the Wikipedia Hawfinch page, and the taxobox source code in edit mode {{Taxobox | color = pink | name = Hawfinch | status = LC | image = CoccCocc.jpg | image_width = 240px | regnum = [[Animal]]ia | phylum = [[Chordate|Chordata]] | classis = [[bird|Aves]] | ordo = [[Passeriformes]] | familia = [[Fringillidae]] | genus = ''[[Coccothraustes]]'' | species = '''''C. coccothraustes''''' | binomial = ''Coccothraustes coccothraustes'' | binomial_authority = ([[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], 1758) }} Indeed color = pink is there. Now go back to the article and look at the taxobox display. Well, pink is there, after all. Which leads to interesting questions. How can the automatic extraction sort the stylesheet properties of the taxobox from the properties of the subject it describes? No way as is now. If Wikipedians knew best, they would split them neatly in the taxobox code. I wonder if infobox templates creators would care to do something about it? Simply replace \"color\" by \"taxobox_color\" would help. Note the subtle semantic ambiguity for image and image_width. The property image can be viewed as a property of the Hawfinch (the value is an image of some Hawfinch), although it's there to call an image in the infobox, along with image_width, so it is also a property of the infobox, somehow. Bernard upink signifies that in wikipedia it is an animal. its an artifact of older wikipedia templates, and more generally that wikipedia is very much about display markup rather than semantic markup. the colors are discussed here: -jg Bernard Vatant wrote: uHello John determined by regnum = Animalia. But you can still override it by an explicit color declaration. Someone not aware of the semiotic rules under the template (pink is for animals, green for vegetal, etc.) can change the color to \"green\" or \"blue\". Nothing prevents you to do so, I just tried. :-) Same remark for the image_width, BTW. Which means the proper use of the template would provide a more semantic markup, and certainly a bot could clean up all useless display markup in the legacy Discussing that again with my son at breakfast, he told me that this was indeed a flaw in the English wikipedia taxobox practice (a soft translation of what he actually said :-[ ). In the French Wikipedia, the color is also built-in in the \"Taxobox animal\" stylesheet, but there is no way to override it (no \"couleur\" slot is available). No wonder la France est le pays de l'Encyclopédie ;-) . Bernard u*VERY* interesting example Bernard, thanks for pointing it out. For me dbpedia provides a wealth of evidence that at least some high-level control of the vocabulary used would be valuable; this is the best example so far in that I think anyone can understand the separation of concerns between information about the display properties of the page vs. information about the thing being described. -Chris Bernard Vatant wrote: uChris Welty wrote: The problem is, that Wikipedia authors currently create and design templates often solely with the goal of having nice infoboxes on the Wikipedia pages. For the infobox extraction we decided to have one global property namespace, so that the \"population\" attribute in the us_cities templates becomes the same DBpedia property as the \"population\" attribute in the german_cities template. This results in the ambiguities Bernard mentioned, but has the advantage, that you can easier query DBpedia in many cases. It is very easy to resolve the ambiguities, by: * defining attribute names globally unique in Wikipedia * introducing a new Wikipedia pagespace for template attributes and let template authors shortly describe their attributes therein. (They could even identify different attributes by simply creating Interwiki links or a small template with a sameAs attribute.) * write a small bot who resolves ambiguities by renaming attributes in certain templates for cases as the one Bernard mentioned If we have the resources for that, we will definitely do it if nobody else did before. Best, Sören uChris Actually I found the example extremely interesting because I got misled myself, although I meet this kind of ambiguity almost daily in explicitation of data semantics with data providers, and I know quite well the why's and how's of Wikipedia infoboxes. Sort of caricature of the daily problems in knowledge extraction from structured data. Sören \"Solely\" is a bit harsh. First aim of infoboxes is to sum up elements of description of the article's subject. Otherwise any knowledge extraction from the infoboxes, such as the one dbpedia performs would be completely meaningless. As the French Wikipedia example shows, it is that the display properties can be hidden under the hood of the style sheet, so that the infobox content is actually a structured description of the thing the article is about, not a self-description of the infobox display. People building infoboxes can understand that. I guess many of them are aware of the data structure / stylesheet distinction, and apply that to the templates they build. Doing so, they make their information much more usable for knowledge extraction. I'm afraid you somehow miss my point here. The problem is not the ambiguity of \"color\" semantics. It's used consistently to represent a color. Pink is pink, be it a bird or an infobox. The ambiguity is at the level of the *subject* to which this property is applied, and origins in the fact that properties applying to different subjects are presented at the same data level, without any possibility to sort them out. It's a completely different issue to decide if \"color\" for birds has the same semantics as \"color\" for quarks. See > It is very easy to resolve the ambiguities, by: In theory, yes. Practically impossible in Wikipedia. Who will define that? Seems to me like defining attribute names globally unique in the Semantic Web. Neither possible nor desirable. This suppose that Wikipedians are more interested in the indirect use of Wikipedia content (data extraction) than its direct use (human consumption). For things much more simple, such as a consistent use of geographical coordinates template, it's already very difficult to achieve a consensus, because many Wikipedians don't want to change their practice to take in consideration the re-use of Wikipedia data. And they have good arguments to do so, based on the independence of the encyclopedia from any external interest (the famous NPOV argument). This can be done on a pragmatic case-by-case basis. Tle more so that in the very example of the animal taxoboxes, the \"color\" property is totally useless > If we have the resources for that, we will definitely do it if nobody What do you mean by that? See above, and be cautious not to provoke a reject reaction from Wikipedia's side. There are a lot of services who now want to use Wikipedia data with more or less (u)nclear business motivations, and will for this purpose, if needed, modify the source content of Wikipedia in such and such a way that fit their needs. This is likely to make Wikipedians more and more nervous about external pressures on the content. Bernard uBernard Vatant wrote: I think if the template attribute you refer to would be named \"infobox-color\" everything is perfectly clear. Of course you still can delve into philosophical discussions whether \"infobox-color\" should be applied to birds, but honestly: I do not care, since it has absolutely no impact. I think it is practically very easily resovable, it will take some discussions with the people responsible for introducing a new namespace, creating awareness in the Wikipedia community and maybe some minor Mediawiki modifications (but I think even they are not really needed). Very possible and desirable! (With globally I did not mean for the whole world, but for the whole Wikipedia.) Many things in Wikipedia are unique: author names, article names, image names etc. It just requires a new namespace for template attributes (and the creation of a page for each template attribute in this namespace). If I would not believe that this is possible I would have stopped working on DBpedia, since without this DBpedia does not make sense. Once a namespace for template attributes is created and there is a page for the infobox-color attribute, we can just include the following template there: {{infobox-attribute| rdf:type=owl:AnnotationProperty }} This will enable the DBpedia extractor to create suitable info about the used properties. Also, it enables to identify different properties by means of a 'owl:sameAs' attribute in the 'infobox-attribute'. Hence, even without changing anything in Wikipedia, we can identify the \"pop\" attribute in the German_cities infobox-template with the population attribute in the US_cities infobox-template. I think the purpose and impact of such a template-attribute namespace is easy to understand and I do not expect lengthy fights about that in the Wikipedia community and as you mentioned earlier Wikipedia template designers are already aware that well designed templates are better. Best, Sören uHi Sören I see you are much more optimistic than I am on the capacity of Wikipedia to accept widespread controlled \"semantic augmentation\". On which basis? Are you active yourself, or someone else from dbpedia, in the Wikipedia community in order to help such things to happen? Have you engaged discussions about it with Wikipedia folks, and with which feedback so far? Supposing the template attribute namespace is defined, who will annotate the attribute pages with the OWL annotations? Do you expect the template-builders to do it? I don't want to seem over-skeptical about it, but just wondering if you have already thought about the real-life implementation, or if it's just so far simply a scenario Bernard Sören Auer a écrit : uBernard Vatant wrote: We have very strong contacts to the German Wikimedia e.V. chapter and some of our students in Leipzig are active Wikipedians and even Mediawiki developers.

Our problem right now is just that we do not have the funds to intensively work on that - we are in the process of acquiring funds to do so, but (as you know) this is very time consuming and lengthy Best, Sören"

"Data Points in Australia coast"	"uHello I have been working with dbpedia the last months, I also asked something about the point values on the mailing list, and you already gave me good advice on other semantic datasets to check. I continued working with dbpedia because I want other information provided about the Points datasets, relations, wikipedia abstracts etc. But I would like to ask again the question on how the point values are generated. Recently I plotted DBpedia points on a map: To determine the most populated zones. There are some errors, but I assume that it's okay, it is impossible not to have errors.

I checked, as you suggested, the live endpoint but the problem persists. Not on all the points, for example Melbourne is okay, but objects. I also would like to note that this page is not in sync with Wikipedia page of Prahran. I'm thinking of the possibility that the extractors source code is okay now, but not when the articles were extracted. Last update of this Wikipedia page is 18 July 2012. I checked the added triples on reference to the Prahran resource. And thanks, I also like the images. When it's done I will upload them at the wiki. Salut! * uHi all, some Wikipedia pages contain coordinates in multiple places, that's why DBpedia extracts multiple values. Some pages using latd values that seem to say that the place is in the Northern hemisphere. Examples: | coordinates = {{Coord|37|48|49|S|144|57|47|E|type:city(4000000)_region:AU-VIC|display=inline,title}} Looks correct - |S| means southern hemisphere, and DBpedia extracts this correctly. | latd =37 |latm =48 |lats =49 | longd =144 |longm =57 |longs =47 To me (and to DBpedia), this looks like Melbourne is in the Northern hemisphere. Similar for {{Coord|-37.852|144.998|format=dms|type:city_region:AU-VIC|display=title}} looks correct |longd=144.998|latd=37.852 looks like Northern hemisphere. This needs further investigation. If the values are wrong, we should find out how many pages are affected. Or maybe Template:Infobox_Australian_place expects the latd value to be positive, because it knows that all values will be in the Southern hemisphere anyway? In this case, we'd have to improve our framework to be able to handle such a special case. JC On Thu, Jul 26, 2012 at 3:57 PM, jordi castells < > wrote:"

"chemistry-related infoboxes"	"uHi list, Like others before me, I am interested in adding to dbpedia's parsing capabilities the power to correctly digest infoboxes that are associated with different types of chemical substances. These infoboxes are not stricly 'infoboxes', in that their names and syntax in the wiki markup is not exactly the same as for the infobox that would show up for, say, Innsbruck. Therefore, these boxes are skipped in the current system. What I am currently trying to do (and please stop me if you have already gotten beyond what I have, or have a better strategy) is to identify how many chemical subcategories (such as Household_chemicals, Solvents, etc.) have well-defined 'chemfoboxes' that could easily be sought out and parsed to create triples. My initial observation is that there are several types of chemfoboxes, so at the moment I am trying to compose a list of which categories of chemicals contain which types of chemfoboxes. When I have enough of these (categories whose members often have chemfoboxes) to cover perhaps a few hundred substances, I will then set to work trying to parse those that have chemfoboxes and ignore gracefully those that don't.

Egon uHi Christian, I suggest you start not with identifying all chemistry related categories, but looking for the different mechanisms/templates for representing chemicals in Wikipedia, like the chembox tables or Chembox_new. help. I created ChemboxExtractor.php for you, so you can start with writing code to parse articles that use the chembox \"template\". Extractors are usually processed on all Wikipedia articles, so I included a preg_match(\"{{chembox header\") at top to ensure the article uses that template before starting to parse. You can use extract.php to get single article sources from Live-Wikipedia, but if you want to try a complete extraction of all articles you will need to install a local Wikipedia MySql database. That's a bit tricky, but you can use our import.php script. It's important to configure MySql adequate, i.e. much memory to the key buffer and other caches.

Happy coding ;) Cheers, Georgi uHi, I have looked at the page you point to, And, so far as I can see, the best way to programmatically obtain as many chemicals that I can see is to use the three pages, And the titles listed in these provide links (when edited, which I have done in relatively little time using vi) to over 1900 chemicals, many of which have chemfoboxes. Unfortunately, these aren't accessible through any of the Category: links I could find, so that it's either up to us to write a custom parser just to get the chemical names, or to manually cut up the pages themselves (as I did, with vi enough shortcuts can be taken that it takes me less than 5 minutes per page). My next step will be to use your ChemboxExtractor.php to produce a file containing the bodies of all these 1900 chemicals, and then have a look at all the data fields that show up inside chemfoboxes, so I can devise a parsing approach. I already have a working local wikipedia installation, so that nightmare needn't be worried about at the moment ;-) Are my messages making it properly to the list? If so, shall I omit your email addresses when responding on this thread?

"Some fun reports"	"uI ran some reports for an importance score against DBpedia here The importance score is proportional to how many hits there were on a topic page and all the redirects to it in Wikipedia. In the report above, the importance is the sum of importance over all units of a type (11 units of importance applied to people, about 7.7 on creative works, and 3.4 on places) If you go into a detail you see the top instances for a given type which are often amusing. Some immediate goals are to look at the cumulative importance distribution (which X% of concepts get Y% of the interest) and also run these on link-derived importance that Andreas Thalhammer published here:"
"DBpediaLive - Update rate statistics"	"uHi all, In changes performed in DBPedia Live during the last minute/hour/day, I would like to know if an history of this (maybe only the daily ones) is available somewhere. What I want in the end is to be able to say something like \"in june 2012, DBPediaLive had an average of xx inserts and yy deletes (if i can also have which pairs insert-delete are related as an update, would be awesome), which represents zz% of the total of triples\". If not, I think it can be done with some scripting (because I'm better in scripting than in Scala), IMHO it would be nice if each daily changeset had an \"statistics\" file like this: numofTriples at start of the day: N1 numofTriples at the end of the day: N2 numof Inserts: I num of Deletes: D num of edits: U I don't know if i can assume that if the same subject appears in a pair insert.file delete.file of the same time, is an update, or if its more complicated than that. If it is, well, inserts and deletes works for me, seeing each pair as an Delete-Insert SPARQL Operation with ground triples and simply counting for the size. What I don't know where I can find is the number of triples in the whole dataset each day. Thanks in advance. uHi Luis, On 07/13/2012 04:27 PM, Luis Daniel Ibáñez González wrote: Actually the statistics you are looking for here are not currently supported by DBpedia-Live, but we will place it in our future plans.

"dbpedia redirects outside "en"?"	"uI was looking at the Dbpedia 3.9 files today and I noticed that redirects are not available for Wikipedia outside \"en\" and I'm wondering why that is. Lately I've cooked down the wikipedia pagecounts to produce a \"3D\" data set that summarizes interest in topics (uh, hits to URIs) over the 2008-2013 time frame. The source code for this is This data has all sorts of problems, but probably the worst of them is that it is chock full of URIs that don't correspond to DBpedia concepts, for instance \"Justin_Bieber_Die_Die_Die_Die Die\", which are caused by people creating junk pages on Wikipedia that get deleted, people typing URIs wrong, etc. The obvious thing to do is to filter out topics that don't exist in DBpedia and also to resolve redirects so that people who visited \"Communists\" get credited as visiting \"Communism\" and so forth. I think a good list of valid DBpedia URIs can be had from the list of page id's in \"en\" and redirects can be gotten out of the \"transitive redirects\".

Maybe you could file a bug at would be great! The number parsers are not yet fully internationalized. They always expect English number format: decimal separator is the dot '.', thousands separator is the comma ',', and spaces cannot be used within a number. This is wrong for many other languages, but explains why the population of Wenzhou is extracted as '1': we try to extract an integer from '1.164.800', and since '.' is expected to be the decimal separator, we just extract '1'. Numbers that contain spaces are parsed as multiple numbers. As for Damascus - we extracted data for Damascus from this revision: (Or a revision close to it. We really should include easily accessible links to the page revision we used) This revison used abitanti =1 614 297 Which has the same problem with spaces as the other cities.

Of course, it's a lot more effort than adding a space character to a regular expression. :-) In general, I think we could and should do a lot more of the configuration on the wiki. Actually, most of it. There are many other extractors besides the mapping based that could even be \"programmed\" on a wiki page, because the basic process is almost always the same: filter pages in a certain namespace, filter certain nodes from their content (templates, links, category links), and get some data from the nodes. But that's a pipe dream. In the shorter run, yes, it would be nice to allow adding special parsing rules to properties. Should we use template properties or ontology properties? Or maybe it would be better to configure them per language? I'm not sure.

I guess this comes down to following best practice for minting URIs, and relying on triples served elsewhere, and generated by other means, to define the human friendly view.

"Announcement: Navigational Knowledge Engineering (NKE) and HANNE"	"uDear Colleagues, over the last year, we have worked on a methodology called Navigational Knowledge Engineering - in short NKE. We have amounted a good deal of documents, a web demo (HANNE) , source code and images, which we publish and link to on this page: Summary: NKE is a light-weight methodology for low-cost knowledge engineering by a massive user base. Although structured data is becoming widely available, no other methodology â to the best of our knowledge â is currently able to scale up and provide light-weight knowledge engineering for a massive user base. Using NKE, data providers can publish flat data on the Web without extensively engineering structure upfront, but rather observe how structure is created on the fly by interested users, who navigate the knowledge base and at the same time also benefit from using it. The vision of NKE is to produce ontologies as a result of users navigating through a system. This way, NKE reduces the costs for creating expressive knowledge by disguising it as navigation. We would also like to steer your attention to the Web Demo [2], the Tutorial slides for the Web demo [3] and two mockups[4], which visualize how the methodology could be integrated into Wikipedia and Amazon.com . As we believe that the methodology is quite novel (please tell us in case you know something similar), we are still discussing all possible applications and implications. In particular, we are searching for suggestions, where to integrate and test our methodology next. Please feel free to contact us.

I understand there is a big load on the server and that some limits must be enforced to that it would not be overloaded with big queries. My concern is how to know when a query reaches one limit so that I can split the query to get the results by chunks. As far as I saw in the mailing list messages, the causes of partial results could be about default (implicit) limits on the number of results. So I though until now that if I put explicit limit in my query I would either get the full result or an exception. But this doesn't seem to be the case in the example given by Andrea : there should be 11 results, sometimes only 5 are given, and the response is given straight away. I am also running an image of DBpedia on virtuoso and I want to understand this to know at least when it can happen. You said there is a way to know when a result is incomplete with the SPARQL Protocol, I have to look at this. Thanks, Julien u0 *H÷  010 +"
"WORLDCOMP Strikes Again for the Last Time"	"uI graduated from University of Florida (UFL) and am currently running a computer firm in Florida. I have attended WORLDCOMP Me and my UFL and UGA friends started a study on WORLDCOMP. We submitted a paper to WORLDCOMP 2011 and again (the same paper with a modified title) to WORLDCOMP 2012. This paper had numerous fundamental mistakes. Sample statements from that paper include: (1). Binary logic is fuzzy logic and vice versa (2). Pascal developed fuzzy logic (3). Object oriented languages do not exhibit any polymorphism or inheritance (4). TCP and IP are synonyms and are part of OSI model (5). Distributed systems deal with only one computer (6). Laptop is an example for a super computer (7). Operating system is an example for computer hardware Also, our paper did not express any conceptual meaning. However, it was accepted both the times without any modifications (and without any reviews) and we were invited to submit the final paper and a payment of $500+ fee to present the paper. We decided to use the fee for better purposes than making Prof. Hamid Arabnia (Chairman of WORLDCOMP) rich. After that, we received few reminders from WORLDCOMP to pay the fee but we never responded. We MUST say that you should look at the website The status of your WORLDCOMP papers can be changed from âscientificâ to âotherâ (i.e., junk or non-technical) at anytime. See the comments Our study revealed that WORLDCOMP is a money making business, using UGA mask, for Prof. Hamid Arabnia. He is throwing out a small chunk of that money (around 20 dollars per paper published in WORLDCOMPâs proceedings) to his puppet who publicizes WORLDCOMP and also defends it at various forums, using fake/anonymous names. The puppet uses fake names and defames other conferences/people to divert traffic to WORLDCOMP. That is, the puppet does all his best to get a maximum number of papers published at WORLDCOMP to get more money into his (and Prof. Hamid Arabniaâs) pockets. Monte Carlo Resort (the venue of WORLDCOMP until 2012) has refused to provide the venue for WORLDCOMPâ13 because of the fears of their image being tarnished due to WORLDCOMPâs fraudulent activities. WORLDCOMP will not be held after 2013. The paper submission deadline for WORLDCOMPâ13 is March 18, 2013 (it will be extended many times, as usual) but still there are no committee members, no reviewers, and there is no conference Chairman. The only contact details available on WORLDCOMPâs website is just an email address! What bothers us the most is that Prof. Hamid Arabnia never posted an apology for the damage he has done to the research community. He is still trying to defend WORLDCOMP. Let us make a direct request to him: publish all reviews for all the papers (after blocking identifiable details) since 2000 conference. Reveal the names and affiliations of all the reviewers (for each year) and how many papers each reviewer had reviewed on average. We also request him to look at the Open Challenge at We think that it is our professional obligation to spread this message to alert the computer science community. Sorry for posting to multiple lists. Spreading the word is the only way to stop this bogus conference. Please forward this message to other mailing lists and people. We are shocked with Prof. Hamid Arabnia and his puppetâs activities Sincerely, Chris I graduated from University of Florida (UFL) and am currently running a computer firm in Florida.

In the past (before adding redirects to the system), the refcount used to simply be the number of inlinks for a resource. But that's not the case for \"redirected\" results: There, the refcount is the number of inlinks for the *redirect* plus a function of the number of inlinks for the resource (something like inlinks(redirect) + log2(inlinks(resource))*100). This way, both the redirect itself and the according resource are weigthed in combination. That's because Wikipedia redirects can't be always threaded as synonyms. There was an example of \"XYZ_(Bill_Clinton's_dog)\" redirecting to \"Bill_Clinton\" in Wikipedia. There, you want to assign a weight to the redirect itself, or else Bill Clinton would show up as result for the keyword \"dog\" Hope that explanation makes sense. Best, Georgi"

"Modelling Provenance of DBpedia Resources Using Wikipedia Contributions"	"uHi, together with Alexandre Passant from DERI Galway we were working on provenance of DBpedia resources. We extract provenance information from Wikipedia and then we semantically represent it and expose it as Linked Data. An article about this work has just been published online on the \"Journal of Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web\", here is the link to it [1], and here is the abstract: Modelling Provenance of DBpedia Resources Using Wikipedia Contributions \"DBpedia is one of the largest datasets in the linked Open Data cloud. Its centrality and its cross-domain nature makes it one of the most important and most referred to knowledge bases on the Web of Data, generally used as a reference for data interlinking. Yet, in spite of its authoritative aspect, there is no work so far tackling the provenance aspect of DBpedia statements. By being extracted from Wikipedia, an open and collaborative encyclopedia, delivering provenance information about it would help to ensure trustworthiness of its data, a major need for people using DBpedia data for building applications. To overcome this problem, we propose an approach for modelling and managing provenance on DBpedia using Wikipedia edits, and making this information available on the Web of Data. In this paper, we describe the framework that we implemented to do so, consisting in (1) a lightweight modelling solution to semantically represent provenance of both DBpedia resources and Wikipedia content, along with mappings to popular ontologies such as the W7  what, when, where, how, who, which, and why  and OPM  open provenance model  models, (2) an information extraction process and a provenance-computation system combining Wikipedia articles history with DBpedia information, (3) a set of scripts to make provenance information about DBpedia statements directly available when browsing this source, as well as being publicly exposed in RDF for letting software agents consume it. \" It would be great to have comments and suggestions from you! Best, Fabrizio [1] j.websem.2011.03.002 uInteresting stuff, but to see anything other than the abstract would cost me $39.95. If you could send me a (p)(r)eprint I could definitely share my thoughts. In semantic work, you've got to evaluate the usefulness of something against particular use cases, so I'll bring up two examples of provenance in DBpedia-derived work that came up recently: (1) I got a complaint from a user who found a highly offensive slur in an abstract that came from DBpedia. In this case I think a student at a high school wrote something bad about the principal. Certainly we could trace this from the Wikipedia history. I like to be proactive when problems turn up, so it would be nice to be able to find other texts that were touched by the same person in case he's a serial vandal. (2) It's a bit out of DBpedia's scope, but I was contacted by a person who wanted to use an image in a book and needed a higher resolution image than was available from Wikimedia Commons. In this case the only provenance information that was there (in semistructured form) told us the image was public domain because it was scanned out of the old book. The provenance information that I wanted was the identity of the old book so these people could have found the book in a library and scanned it themselves. In this case the information just wasn't there and the only route forward would be a perscomm to the person who uploaded it. uHi, thanks for pointing that out, you can download the paper also from here: You're right, the first example you provided is exactly one of the reasons for our work presented in this paper. I think your second example is more related to the kind of metadata that Wikimedia provides (or should provide) on its MediaWiki wikis (e.g. Wikipedia). Thanks, Fabrizio On 19/05/11 18:42, Paul Houle wrote: uHi, On 24/05/11 01:32, Paul Houle wrote: Thanks! That's right, applying this work to Wikipedia entirely using the Wikipedia API would be a problem, as you have seen we did that only on a subset of the WIkipedia articles. In that case using the full dump of Wikipedia would speed up the process considerably. In our case the solution adopted was quicker. As regards the huge amount of triples that would have been generated, in the provenance research field this is still described as one of the \"major technology gaps in the state of the art\" (See the W3C Provenance Incubator Group Report [1]). 7 billion triples in the resulting dataset, after running the provenance extraction process on the full Wikipedia dump, can be a problem indeed. However, there are some working implementations of triplestores serving more than 10 billion triples [2]. In addion, we should consider advances in RDF storage with new triple stores that may handle such amount of data, and clustering architectures to do so. At the moment I think it would be nice to have provenance information in DBpedia describing only the latest version of the Wikipedia article that generated the corresponding latest triples on DBpedia. Without the record of all the previous edits/versions. Publishing provenance information in RDF is useful especially for building tools and applications capable of analysing and reasoning on this data. One example can be to provide trust and quality metrics about Wikipedia articles and their editors. Or in case of conflicting statements from different sources being able to choose the preferred source, etc. Not sure this answers your question Thanks for the feedback!

"Missing links among categories?"	"uDear all, I'm trying to derive a tree of categories from DBPedia but as I get so many top categories I have taken a deeper look into the data and compared it with the Wikipedia counterpart. It seems that there are many missing broader links among categories, at least from what there is in Wikipedia. For instance, compare: In DBPedia, there is just a broader link from no outgoing broader or narrower link. In Wikipedia, there are 10 subcategories (from 1910 births to 1919 births) and two supercategories (1910s and 20th-century births). Has someone experimented similar issues? Is there another available dump of the Wikipedia categories using SKOS? Any help appreciated, Best, Roberto GarcÃ­a ~roberto uHi, 2011/1/14 Roberto GarcÃ­a < >: The DBpedia extraction framework operates on the wiki source code of Wikipedia. For category pages, it extracts skos:broader relations using links to other category pages. This works well for example in this case: Unfortunately, it is difficult for the extraction framework to deal with all the different templates that Wikipedia offers its contributers. Looking at the wiki source code of almost the complete page is created by two templates ({{birthdecade|}} and {{Commons cat|}}). Therefore, the extraction does not find many links to other categories and cannot produce the desired data. I know this does not provide a solution to your problem, but perhaps a better understanding. Cheers, Max"

"Data returned on dbpedia.org/ontology/"	"uHi group, We work on some software which heavily relies on the ontologies used by the data. This means we dereference the ontologies used on data sets and do some inference to figure out additional stuff about the data. For most ontologies this works pretty well. Last week we were test driving our software against some data at DBPedia, namely the page of Tim Berners-Lee at So far so good, in there we have several rdf:type definitions, including dbpedia-owl:Person, which points to On that point we noticed that it took way too long to get the page, cache it and do some stuff on it.

So we get the other file instead. And boy were we confused: It returns an 8MB file for the request (which took quite some time to get btw) After analyzing it in rapper I figured out that we got about 50'000 triples, probably less than 20 are really related to the ontology and the rest is stuff like: a . While I do see that this \"reverse property\" or however it is called might be interesting when I browse the data set in my web browser it is in my opinion plain wrong to return it on the URI which dereferences the ontology. Our software is also targeted at smart phones, you can imagine that it is not really fun to get 50'000 triples back on a crappy 3G link with volume limits and then parse and cache them on a device which is running on battery power. If I do that on several dbpedia data sets I'm probably out of power very soon and didn't even get half of the ontologies used in the data. What is your opinion on that? Is there a good reason for this or did you just think it might be useful? As you can see this pretty much kills the way we use ontologies and I think the \"classical\" way to dereference ontologies makes way more sense, so I would vote to change this behavior on dbpedia and return uniquely the definition itself. thanks cu Adrian u+100!

[Disclaimer: I don't know Eclipse well, I don't know Maven ar all!] As far as I can tell, I followed instructions listed at: [Except for installing a scala plugin, since I already had one installed on my eclipse, and was able to write scala projects with it which work fine] I tried to have maven directly download the snv repo, but that did not compile, as a matter of fact I was not even able to see the source files, even though they had been downloaded to my disc. I tried another way, downloading the svn repo manually, and then import in maven. That get slightly better, since I was then able to view the source under Eclipse (though the icon for scala files is a dim blue \"J\", instead of a dark blue \"S\" as in my own project). But the projects (core, dsump, scripts, server, wiktionary) still have a red cross, and project \"live\" has a red \"!\" sign. Looking at the pom.xml (in Eclipse GUI) of \"live\", I see: * Missing artifact com.openlink.virtuoso:virtjdbc:jar:6.1.2:compile But if I look inside maven console, it seems that maven has downloaded this, even multiple times (at lines #13, #82, #152, #244, #252, #291, #330) : 04/03/11 06:21:12 CET: Downloaded 04/03/11 06:21:23 CET: Downloaded 04/03/11 06:21:34 CET: Downloading 04/03/11 06:24:46 CET: Downloaded 04/03/11 06:26:48 CET: Downloaded 04/03/11 06:26:58 CET: Downloaded 04/03/11 06:27:08 CET: Downloaded [I'm skipping 2 or 3 extra occurrences] line #462, I see: 04/03/11 06:29:18 CET: Missing artifact com.openlink.virtuoso:virtjdbc4:jar:6.1.2:compile I find this message quite surprising, since, from previous log, it seems that said jar has already been downloaded 9-10 times!

Thanks in advance. uHi there, Since Eclipse seems (very) reluctant to let me build dbpedia's extraction, I thought I'd try maven directly from the command tool So, after getting a suitable maven (2.2.1), I went into the \"extraction\" directory and typed \"mvn clean install\".

"page links"	"uJust some thoughts here: (1) Sometimes page links get repeated. I think this is just because page A has N links to page B. This doesn't have much semantic impact, but it does bulk up the files a bit (though less w/ bz2) and makes more work for my importer script (2) Some page links point to articles that don't exist. That's a good thing, because \"broken links\" are important to the whole wiki concept. Right now my system is ignoring that stuff, but I've done plenty of stuff with link analysis where you can get good insight about a some set of documents S by looking at links to the expanded set of documents S' that includes (real or imagined) documents that are referred to in document S. (3) Might be nice to extract the anchor text together with the link, though then we're not talking about a triple anymore and have to put in some of those dreaded blank nodes I've been think about training decision rules for a namexer by capturing the text context that pagelinks occur in, but I'd have to write my own extractor to do that. u2010/5/5 Paul Houle < >: That can be important to some extent when computing the PageRank of the wikipedia graph. Or other graph algorithms to mesure the proximity / relatedness of entities. BTW, that would be great if the DBpedia project could compute and distribute the PageRank or the TunkRank [1] values for the DBpedia resources based on the data of the page links graph. This is a really good scoring heuristic when performing fuzzy text named queries with several homonymic matches. [1] Or this could be extracted in an adhoc CSV file since I don't really see the point in having those in a knowlege base / triple store but this is precious data for training machine learning based NLP models. uOlivier Grisel wrote: Olivier, Have you looked at this interface to DBpedia: Also look at the Entity Rank details in the \"About\" section.

One of them is that you treat the in-links and out-links of documents as a 'vector' and compute vector space distances. I've done this with scientific papers [arxiv.org] When the local fan-in and fan-out is high, this can be a good way to find 'related documents'. Developing the NY Pictures site, I generated a list of \"topics related to NYC\" and then computed two aggregates over link targets: (i) incoming links from all other pages, (ii) incoming links from the NYC topic Television networks (many of which were based in NYC) were very strong topics by measure (i) but were much less strong by measure (ii). The New York Times was still very strong just looking at links 'local' topics, I think because the NYT was often cited to support WP articles. Doing the vector space stuff I was talking about above, I found that the local fan-in and fan-out was critical for it working In principle it should work very poorly for scientific papers that are cited only two or three times [most of them] but it does better than you'd think, since there's a strong positive correlation between how some papers get cited [one of mine is always cited together with another paper that came out in the same issue of Physical Review] I think looking for link density between categories, spatial regions, types, etc should be a lot of fun and fruitful since the statistics are going to be better.

We were interested in estimating the PMI for pairs of concepts (entities, events, ) that Wikipedia articles denote. The Wikipedia convention is that if you mention a Wikipedia object, you link the first mention to the appropriate Wikipedia article. This has advantages over using, for example, a search engine to find the PMI of two strings that are entity mentions (e.g., \"George Bush\", \"Mr. Quale\") since both are ambiguous. We estimate the PMI for two Wikipedia articles based just on their mentions in other Wikipedia articles, So, given a pair of Wikipedia articles X and Y we compute log(p(X&Y;)/p(X)*p(Y)) where p(X&Y;) is the probability that a Wikipedia page will link to both X and Y and p(X) is the probability that a page will link to X.

"SPARQL: restricting DESCRIBE queries"	"uHi, is there any way to limit the number of triples returned by a DESCRIBE query? The LIMIT clause of sparql obviously applies to the number of result bindings, but each result binding may lead to an arbitrary number of triples. Consider the following queries against dbpedia: SELECT ?concept WHERE { ?concept rdfs:label \"Berlin\"@en . } LIMIT 1 returns one result, whereas SELECT ?concept WHERE { ?concept rdfs:label \"Berlin\"@en . } LIMIT 2 returns two results. Now, DESCRIBE ?concept WHERE { ?concept rdfs:label \"Berlin\"@en . } LIMIT 1 returns 28 triples describing dbpedia:Category:Berlin, while DESCRIBE ?concept WHERE { ?concept rdfs:label \"Berlin\"@en . } LIMIT 2 returns some ~4500 triples because it includes the description of dbpedia:Berlin.

There is no way to limit the number of triples in DESCRIBE, because the LIMIT clause in DESCRIBE applies to the number of described *resources*, not to the number of triples in those descriptions. I would perhaps execute the SELECT query that you give below, and then for each of the results of that query, run a \"SELECT * WHERE { ? p ?o}\" with a LIMIT clause, followed by \"SELECT * WHERE {?s ?p }\". Also note that LIMIT is not truly meaningful without ORDER BY. Best, Richard u2009/9/8 Richard Cyganiak < >: You won't however pick up the contents of any nested blank nodes using this method that would have been pulled in by the DESCRIBE implementations on most SPARQL providers, both because they won't have URI's to perform the SELECT on and because the final two sets of queries only pull in one level of nodes. Also, any blank node references in the results of the final SELECT queries can't be joined because they are independent. This area of SPARQL is very messy due to blank nodes, particularly as DESCRIBE hasn't been fully specified and doesn't have configurable behaviour with respect to the GRAPH patterns it uses when resolving the triples related to the resource so you either use DESCRIBE and put up with the lack of a triple LIMIT or use it and get stuck with everything at once even if you didn't want the ?s ?p triples (where ?s is a URI) but you did want blank node recursive closure. ORDER BY is quite slow on all current SPARQL implementations with large datasources in the background. It is no wonder people don't use it even though they technically should. And sometimes you even get errors using ORDER BY [1] (when you didn't previously ;) ) as I did when I attempted to add ORDER BY to this query: SELECT ?concept ?p ?o WHERE { ?concept rdfs:label \"Berlin\"@en . ?concept ?p ?o .} ORDER BY ?concept LIMIT 5000 I am not sure if that error is a Virtuoso bug or a configuration bug.

"Redirection"	"uKingsley, On reflection, I have come to the conclusion that it was rather dumb of me to assume that I could do arbitrary URL redirects, just because the 303 mechanism is used to distinguish pages from RDF resources. In effect, I am asking any RDF-aware tool that wants to use my resources to support redirection at a point when it isn't expecting to have to. Even if you were to add this support for your RDF browser, this wouldn't change the situation for the next tool I (or someone else) tried to use. Therefore I now plan to build the RDF generation directly into the ASP which handles 404s, so that the \"resource\" URL actually delivers RDF.

"Use of dbpedia-owl classes in other ontologies"	"uI'm curious about what people think of the appropriateness of using a class from the dbpedia ontology as the range in another ontology. Here's the particular case I have in mind. I'm working on an app that will ask faculty at my school to give additional info about their courses by using references to wikipedia pages, and hence to dbpedia. So we'd have triples like: ex:Course1 univ:studiesPerson dbres:Michelangelo . The range of univ:studiesPerson should be just fine as dbpedia-owl:Person. But, imagine this is an art class, and a particular work of art they are studying is the Pieta. It would be nice to have a property univ:studiesWork with range dbpedia-owl:Work to make a triple like: ex:Course1 univ:studiesWork dbres:Piet%C3%A0_(Michelangelo) Inference would then say that the resource for the Pieta is a dbpedia-owl:Work, which I think makes conceptual sense, but I worry that it might run afoul of how those classes came about and how they work (no pun intended). So, what's the consensus on using dbpedia-owl classes as the range for properties in other ontologies? Thanks much, Patrick Murray-John http://semantic.umwblogs.org uHi Peter, There was a long discussion on w3c-semweb mailinglist about the dbpedia ontology. But that discussion focused on our use of domains and ranges in dbpedia ontology properties. Some people complained that those properties can't / shouldn't be used in other datasets because our domains and ranges might led to strange reasoning results. However, I'd say you're save using dbpedia ontology classes, especially those first-level-hierarchy classes such as Person, Work, Place, Organization, etc. Thing is, there're no descriptions of dbpedia ontology classes available. What is a Person? What is a Work? What is an Organization? In my opinion, common sense provides answers to these questions. Whether or not common sense is a valid criterion is a different question Other opinions, anybody? Best, Georgi"

In summary, I think DBpedia should encode as few characters as possible, e.g. use '&', not '%26'. The URI spec [1] has a lot of special cases, but in the end it's quite clear that in our case we do not HAVE to encode most special characters like '&'. See 3.3 Path Component. More importantly, the RDF spec includes the following note [2]: Because of the risk of confusion between RDF URI references that would be equivalent if derefenced, the use of %-escaped characters in RDF URI references is strongly discouraged. Could hardly be clearer A related, but different issue is how Wikipedia and Virtuoso dereference URIs. Wikipedia is very lenient: \"&_(EP)\" [3] is equivalent to \"%26_%28EP%29\" [4]. Even \"OS%2F2\" [5] is treated as equivalent to \"OS/2\" [6]. (Not sure which of these bahaviors is or isn't violating the URI spec). Virtuoso on dbpedia.org is very strict: it only returns data for \"OS/2\" [7] and \"&_%28EP%29\" [8], but empty pages for all other encoding variants.

I didn't check the codes >= 0xA0, I trust you copied them correctly. ;-) As for the special ASCII chars, yes, those are the ones that are allowed by RFC 3986. Its predecessor explains nicely why the others forbidden. I compiled a blacklist below. I added 'ok' to those that IMHO clearly must be escaped. For some, I don't really see a reason why they are forbidden (I wrote 'don't know' below), but they are pretty rare and we sure should escape them. For others, I still don't see a reason, but MediaWiki doesn't use them so we shouldn't either [2] (I wrote 'ok for wikipedia'). We shouldn't even generate any URIs containing any of these characters, escaped or not, subject or object. (They may occur in where we must escape them.) The one character that we should not escape is the slash. MediaWiki actually unescapes it when it is used in an internal link. [1] But that's an implementation detail. It may be cleaner to have a generic IRIEscaper and afterwards just do uri.replace(\"%2F\", \"/\"). forbidden characters: \" - don't know # - ok % - ok / - not ok < - ok ? - ok [ - ok for wikipedia \ - don't know ] - ok for wikipedia ^ - don't know ` - don't know { - ok for wikipedia | - ok for wikipedia } - ok for wikipedia Regards, JC [1] [2] On Tue, Mar 6, 2012 at 02:09, Paul A.

There are a number of \"territories\" such as Somaliland, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria that claim sovereignty, levy taxes, and some level of diplomatic recognitions with some countries. There have also been a number of projects where people have tried to start countries in obscure places because they wanted to create a tax jurisdiction or hoped to get an ccTLD.

If you want data quality changed, it would be best for you to focus on Wikipedia rather than DBpedia IMO. Have you tried talking to the people at [1] about your concerns?

Methodologically, however, the last kind of query that I want to run over DBpedia live (or freebase) is a query like \"give me a list of all cities;\" that kind of query almost certainly overruns the returned limit of either the SPARQL or MQL implementation. If I end up rebuilding 'Isidore', my framework for combing through lots of records in generic databases, it's going to be around a 'taxonomic core' that keeps track of identifying identification for objects and of the major classes that organize them. That's something that I like building from a general dump, because I feel more confident that I didn't run into 'data holes' hidden by an API. Practically, a complete taxonomic core for dbpedia and Freebase is reasonably small and easy to handle. Once I've got it, I can (in principle) identify classes of objects that I'm interested in and then use SPARQL or MQL APIs to fill in details about particular ones. For instance, for ny-pictures, I found about 10,000 'things' related to New York City and loaded those into a system that's pretty heavyweight and expensive. I found both dbpedia live and live access to freebase to be very useful for filling out information that was missing from the dbpedia dump that I started ny-pictures from; in particular, a lot of geographical coordinates have been added in the last few month. Along these lines, I really like the topic dumps that metaweb publishes; these are good 'map' of Freebase which makes it possible to selectively pick out stuff to look at with MQL, without having to figure out how to interpret those big FB dump files. uPaul Houle wrote: Build a Data Window using OFFSET and LIMIT.

"Official DBpedia Live Release"	"uDear all, the AKSW [1] group is pleased to announce the official release of DBpedia Live [2]. The main objective of DBpedia is to extract structured information from Wikipedia, convert it into RDF, and make it freely available on the Web. In a nutshell, DBpedia is the Semantic Web mirror of Wikipedia. Wikipedia users constantly revise Wikipedia articles with updates happening almost each second. Hence, data stored in the official DBpedia endpoint can quickly become outdated, and Wikipedia articles need to be re-extracted. DBpedia Live enables such a continuous synchronization between DBpedia and Wikipedia. The DBpedia Live framework has the following new features: 1. Migration from the previous PHP framework to the new Java/Scala DBpedia framework. 2. Support of clean abstract extraction. 3. Automatic reprocessing of all pages affected by a schema mapping change at 4. Automatic reprocessing of pages that are not changed for more than one month. The main objective of that feature is to that any change in the DBpedia framework, e.g. addition/change of an extractor, will eventually affect all extracted resources. It also serves as fallback for technical problems in Wikipedia or the update stream. 5. Publication of all changesets. 6. Provision of a tool to enable other DBpedia mirrors to be in synchronization with our DBpedia Live endpoint. The tool continuously downloads changesets and performs changes in a specified triple store accordingly. Important Links: * SPARQL-endpoint: * DBpedia-Live Statistics: * Changesets: * Sourcecode: * Synchronization Tool: Thanks a lot to Mohamed Morsey, who implemented this version of DBpedia Live as well as to Sebastian Hellmann and Claus Stadler who worked on its predecessor.

It generates all the files at are loaded in the official endpoint ( the English Wikipedia, but also labels and abstracts in different languages.

Anyway, I know this is early days on the live.dbpedia.org side of things, and this is more about a SPARQL endpoint than entire Linked Data deliverable.

In this case, I would choose to see contains assertions about abbreviate to live:Slightly_Odway and dbpedia:Slightly_Odway respectively. An HTTP request to live:Slightly_Odway would return a description of a graph named live:Slightly_Odway, which in turn has quadruples about dbpedia:Slightly_Odway. dbpedia:Slightly_Odway rdf:type ns7:DebutAlbums live:Slightly_Odway . dbpedia:Slightly_Odway rdf:type ns7:JebediahAlbums live:Slightly_Odway The fact that it returns a description of itself complies with Linked Data principles. The fact that these triples are talking about another URI may look unconventional at first, but it's actually common in the wild. See [1]: yago-res:Slightly_Odway owl:sameAs ns2:Slightly_Odway . We might need to add some mechanism to convey in triples the same message of the quadruples, or we may assume that if somebody asks for NT, they do not care about the provenance, and just serve triples about dbpedia:Slightly_Odway. If they ask for NQ, then we give them the quadruples. This solution would allow people to easily integrate data in a simple query, retaining the ability of telling apart the sources, without requiring inference.

If you want to know, just follow the link I think you mix something up. Don't put semantics into URIs! every predicate is a URI and thus has to follow the URI conventions[1], and that's it. From that, it is totally arbitrary and semantic agnostic. A label, on the other hand, would be something like skos:prefLabel where you get the natural language label (as values of skos:prefLabel predicate). This can be used for the presentation level of your app. See [2] for an example, 1. as an arbitrary URI and 2. look at the skos:prefLabel where you find the preferred labels for this URI in different languages. While URIs are semantically agnostic I personally find it convenient to have something speaking like dct:title in comparison to isbd:P1006 .

CamelCase is easier to read. You can look at concatenated strings and see the words immediately 2. I18N: well, I have to admit, it is a little bit unfair to use English names in URIs, but these are more for developers. Normally, you wouldn't have any special chars in your Java or Python method names: \"public void Ã¼bersetzen () {} \" would be very unusual. However, internationalization is a real problem, here are pointers: There is a paper about this here: and also a W3C group (you are welcome to join): 3. The discussion whether to use readable URIs or IDs is very old. I couldn't find a good thread, but you might start here: Both have advantages, IDs are more scalable and also you can have versioning.

"DBpedia Project Update and Freebase Interlinking"	"uHi all, a quick update on what is happening around DBpedia along the lines of: 1. Freebase 2. Data Quality 3. Live Data There were great news from Freebase at ISWC. They are now providing a Linked Data interface which makes the complete content of Freebase accessible to the Semantic Web. This is especially exiting for DBpedia as both datasets have a large overlap and having RDF access to Freebase makes it easy to mashup and fusion both datasets. We are currently in the process of generating links from DBpedia to Freebase for all 2.49 million things in DBpedia. These links will go online sometime next week and will immediately allow to mash Freebase and DBpedia data for instance using tools like the Marbles Linked Data browser (which does owl:sameAs smushing). The links could also be the foundation for further work on fusing Freebase and DBpedia data, which I think will be very exiting and might show that the Semantic Web itself is developing into the world's database being fuelled by various valuable sources. There are also good news concerning DBpedia's two main problems: Low data quality and stall data. Georgi, Anja and Paul are getting close to publish a new cleaned-up DBpedia dataset based on the current Wikipedia dump. This extraction uses a new framework based on manual mappings of hundreds of Wikipedia templates to a clean ontology and improved datatype extraction algorithms. The new dataset is supposed to be released next week and should be clean enough to allow RDFS subsumption reasoning as well as to use it within facet browsering UIs. There is also great progress towards getting the DBpedia dataset current and synchronise it with Wikipedia changes: SÃ¶ren managed to convince the Wikipedia foundation to give us access to the Wikipedia live update stream, which tracks all changes in Wikipedia itself. Thanks a lot to the foundation for this! This is exactly what we needed. Based on this update stream we can sync DBpedia and Wikipedia, which will mean about 20 000 updates to the DBpedia dataset per day. Orri from OpenLink meant that this is no problem for the Virtuoso server which is used to host the DBpedia SPARQL endpoint and Linked Data interface. Thus after the new dataset is released, we will look into extending the extraction framework for continuous updates and are looking forward to be able to server a live version a DBpedia soon.

On Linux/Unix/MacOs they do not have the typical C:/, D:/, E:/ drivesbut rather a file system that mounts the folder directly so you need to have an easy way to find your folders(therefore \home\release\ would be just fine). You can as well put C:/wikipedia/ on windows for thatHowever I really have no idea what folder you need to use for MediaWiki under Windows. As I told you I was not interested in the abstracts Also somehow this path C:/Users/ANM/extraction-framework/extraction_ framework/.hg/extraction_framework/dump doesn't seems quite rightIt's just a feelingbut you should not have any .hg folders (related to old Mercurial dependencies I guess) At least as far as I remember I had no similar pathhmmI'm a bit lost here All my paths were clean C:/extraction-framework/dump directly Best regards, Adrian On Sat, Jul 27, 2013 at 10:21 PM, Abdullah Nasser < >wrote:"

From there you get hex-values with names (titles). The top 25 results are: * Names are weird though Hope this helps. Take care, Fred * uThanks for the quick reply Frederick, Hmm, List_of_colors does exist, and I got the basic results via this query on dbpedia's endpoint: SELECT * WHERE { ?p ?o} Please try this link: Can you check and see if that works?

Thanks also for the example you gave; that's a great way to get the names but due to the inconsistencies of the wikipedia content there's not too many colors that match the query.

"RelFinder - Version 1.0 released"	"uSteffen Lohmann wrote: Steffen, Very cool! Please add: endpoints. The effect of doing this ups the implications of this tool exponentially! Try it yourself e.g. Google to Apple (use the DBpedia URIs). The density of the graph, the response time provide quite an experience to the user (especially a Linked Data neophyte). Notes about URIBurner: 1. Quad Store is populated progressively with contributions by anyone that uses the service to seek structured descriptions of an HTTP accessible resource via ODE bookmarklets, browser extensions, or SPARQL FROM Clause that references external Data Sources 2. As part of the graph construction process it not only performs RDF model transformation (re. non RDF data sources); it also performs LOD cloud lookups and joins, ditto across 30+ Web 2.0 APIs 3. Anyone with a Virtuoso installation that enables the RDF Mapper VAD (which is how the Sponger Middleware is packaged) ends up with their own personal or service specific variant of URIBurner. Again, great stuff, this tool is going to simplify the message, a lot re., Linked Data and its penchant for serendipitous discovery of relevant things. uHi all, we are happy to announce the release of version 1.0 of the RelFinder. The RelFinder is a tool that extracts and visualizes relationships between given objects in Semantic Web datasets and makes these relationships interactively explorable. It advances the idea of the DBpedia Relationship Finder by offering improved visualization and exploration techniques and working with any dataset that provides SPARQL access. Some key features are: - relationships even between more than two given objects (all visualized in one 'relationship graph') - easy configurability of the accessed dataset and search parameters (via settings menu or config file) - aggregations and global filters (based on relationship length, class, link type, connectivity) - highly interactive visualization (highlighting, red thread, pick&pin;, details on demand, animations) The RelFinder is implemented in Adobe Flex and requires only a Webbrowser with installed Flash Player. Give it a try at have not been aware of before ;-) Thanks go to Jens Lehmann, Jürgen Ziegler, Lena Tetzlaff, Laurent Alquier & Sebastian Hellmann. Best regards, Philipp, Timo & Steffen uThanks Kingsley, I quickly added URIBurner as a dataset but cannot see the added value w.r.t. the RelFinder - your Google-Apple example produces mainly \"seeAlso\" links, which are not that helpful to discover new relationships. Here is the link with the parameters: Once again a demonstration that variety of link types is a big challenge when automatically generating RDF data (link variety is indeed important for the RelFinder). Anyways - thanks for the pointer. We are generally interest in integrating further datasets to the RelFinder's default installation (as long as they produce valuable relationships). Further ideas and links are welcome! Steffen uSteffen Lohmann wrote: There is little more to whats going on with URIBurner. Lets say your understood specific relationships exposed via seeAlso, you could knock a simple RDF document and the have URIBurner consume it (or just SPARQL the resource from its /sparql), then go back to Relfinder to see the effect. There is something that still isn't quite clear about what I am trying to demonstrate re. progressive construction of Linked Data Spaces :-) Static Data is a commodity with diminishing value. We have to be able to move from generality to specificity, in an unobtrusive way re. any Web of Linked Data :-) Kingsley"

With dbpedia.org, the result abstract string is suffixed with \"@en\", and with suffixed with with \"^^ \". Maybe there's a general problems with abstracts? Thanks, uAll, There is currently a problem with the extraction code that stripped the language from abstracts and a couple of similar tags. We have taken the extraction stream offline while we make a bugfix in the extraction code and perform a hotfix to our database to restore the language tag on these strings.

This might be because Wikipedia editors tend to use more generic templates, e.g. Person instead of Actor. DBpedia uses these templates to map the resource to a class from the DBpedia ontology. This is truly an issue, a lot of interesting stuff is removed from infoboxes in a concerted way, e.g. notable works, influenced persons, and more. It would be interesting to check, whether (and which) relevant information from past versions could be perpetuated to be continuously part of current releases. I cannot say when this was the case. DBpedia Live and the Releases are not published together and results are not mixed. DBpedia Live extracts the latest state from Wikipedia as soon as the article changes, so there may be little date time differences between the extraction times of individual articles. The releases on the opposite side are all based on a single dump from Wikipedia, i.e. all having the same extraction time. Furthermore, the release cycle allows to do more complex extractions, e.g. internationalization, page links, and post processing steps such as type inference, page rank, etc. These are not feasible with the constant flux date nature of DBpedia Live.

"fixing up the sports classes in the DBpedia ontology"	"uThere are about 100 sports-related classes in the DBpedia ontology. Given this number, one might think that quite a bit of attention has been paid to the sports domain in DBpedia, and that it is well organized. However, the opposite is true. There are at least 12 sports-related groupings of classes: Sport itself, SportsLeague, SportsTeam, SportsTeamMember, Athlete, Coach, SportsManager, CareerStation, SportsEvent, SportFacility, SportCompetitionResult, and SportsSeason. There is insufficient organization of these classes. For example, Coach and SportsManager should be related to each other somehow. Sport, SportsLeague, SportsTeam, Athlete, Coach, SportsManager, SportsEvent, SportFacility, and SportsSeason all have subclasses. However, these subclasses are different for each of these classes. For example, there is AutoRacingLeague, SpeedwayLeague, and FormulaOneRacing but only SpeedwayTeam and FormulaOneRacing. Even the generalization structures of these subclasses differs, with GridironFootballPlayer being a generalization of AmericanFootballPlayer and CanadianFootballPlayer, but no gridiron generalization of AmericanFootballLeague and CanadianFootballLeague, or of AmericanFootballTeam and CanadianFootballTeam, or of AmericanFootballCoach. There are also missing property values for many instances of these classes. For example, sports leagues do not have an associated sport. What should be done is a complete rewrite of the sports area. All sports-related classes should be placed in the correct place in the DBpedia ontology. Classes like AmericanFootballPlayer should be defined as the class of athletes who play american football. Mappings then do not have to be to these sorts of classes, but can just assert the general sports-related class and the appropriate property value. This requires the expressive power of OWL, however, and may be too radical of a change. There are other changes that should also be made, such as having a hierarchy of sports, but Wikipedia does not have data to source this hierarchy. These changes requires the use of OWL constructs that have not appeared in the DBpedia ontology to date, however, and this this may be too radical of a change. Perhaps all that can be done is to regularize the sports categories, and ensure that sports-related objects are connected to the correct sport. This would require harmonizing the mappings for the Infobox sports league and other mappings that generate sports-related classes so that they use the same rules for their eventual class and so that they include a link to the sport itself. Comments? Is it possible to do either of these for 3.10? peter"
"Odp: probably incorrect mapping to schema.org from MusicalArtist"	"uI have a somewhat mixed feeling regarding the organization of Wikipedia. It is true that if you use it as a human, you will find what you need in a reasonable time (usually using search box and following direct category links). But from the POV of a KB engineer, its organization is very far from being perfect. Let me just give you an example: administrative categories in Wikipedia. These are categories that should not be normally displayed to the end-user. You would expect that there is one, maybe two means of expressing that given category is administrative (e.g. a container category and a template). But there are at least several ways of stating that a given category is administrative - sometimes this information is only stated in the contents of the category. Another example - eponymous categories. You have Cat_main template, which is used to state that there is a corresponding article for a given category. You also have Main template, which has similar meaning. But in majority of the situations the link between the cat. and article is only provided as a link at the beginning of the category contents or as the first item on the list of category articles. So I have doubts regarding construction of a well-structured ontology that would emerge e.g. from the usage of infobox templates in Wikipedia. I am not saying that Cyc or Umbel are perfect (they are not), there are also duplications and unnecessary classes there. But Cyc has been constructed for more than 20 years and I believe that many of the problems we are discussing here were already discussed during Cyc creation. Let me just say that you have 3 concepts in Cyc that correspond to \"church\": * #$ChurchService * #$Church-Building * #$Church-LocalCongregation I am not saying that the mapping we will produce in May or June will provide the correct classes in all the cases (this is just not feasible), but I am saying that the necessary concepts are already present in Cyc (and Umbel). And if they are really missing we will provided them and attach to the rich structure of Cyc/Umbel. Kind regards, Aleksander uHi, the kind of ambiguity we are discussing is well known in lexical semantics: it is called âsystematic polysemyâ. In practice, certain terms are used to express several related meanings. Patterns emerge out of these phenomena, e.g. Place/Building/Community, which the Cyc concepts noticed by Aleksander are an occurrence of. Systematic polysemy was originally described by James Pustejovsky, and studied in detail within WordNet by Paul Buitelaar. Trying to resolve that ambiguity is a typical formal ontology task, but this task is sometimes in conflict with common sense, and especially with linguistic and informal data. Pat Hayes (as far as I remember) used to call the excess of distinction âontological overcommitmentâ. In fact there are even cognitive experiments that prove the importance of âcontrolledâ ambiguity for fast and efficient thinking [6]. As an ontology designer that spent quite a time trying to understand how and when it is useful to make distinctions, I would recommend to follow the crowdsourced value of Wikipedia: there is structure there, but often it is not what we would like to find as formal ontologists or logicians. And this is not a âproblem\" in my view: we need to understand what is relevant, and to derive requirements from it. If there are structures in Wikipedia that produce exceptions in DBpedia, and derivatively in potential formal orderings of classes and properties, such exceptions should be studied as empirical phenomena, not as âdirtinessâ to be corrected. From this perspective, the DBpedia ontology is simply not informed by either criteria: it does not try to be formally correct, but it does not try to follow empirical science rules either. Thatâs why I was recommending to look at properties and mappings first. As far as Kingsleyâs recommendation to âtriangulateâ with other ontologies, thatâs a good one, but it should be accompanied by understanding what is the actual data-oriented ontology of DBpedia-Wikipedia. Let me reference some examples of this empirical research conducted by my lab: [1][2][3], and there is more of course in the literature, e.g. [4][5].

Besides the category issues Aleksander notes, there is another source of issues with the Wikipedia structure: compound categories. By \"compound categories\" we mean categories that combine a main subject with additional attributes or characteristics. Some examples for English are shown under [1]. Excluding administrative categories in the English Wikipedia, about half of categories are of this compound type. They often have prepositions, certain articles, or certain heads in the titles. (I will say that some of the compound categories are being converted over time to list categories 'List of XXX', which is another challenge.) These kinds of category problems exhibit themselves in how Wikipedia is used. First, my understanding is that Wikipedia's own structured effort, Wikidata, has chosen not to use the Wikipedia categories or the DBpedia ontology for their organizing structure [2]. Second, I think it can be fairly argued that most users of Wikipedia use it for lookup of specific references and related relationships. I know of very few examples where Wikipedia is used for casual discovery or navigation, uses which would rely on the Wikipedia structure. That you are willing, Peter, to work to improve the DBpedia ontology is fantastic. We ourselves have just spent tens of hours doing a manual mapping of the 650 or so classes in the DBpedia ontology to Cyc and UMBEL. I hope to post a link to that shortly; it may aid in some of your own efforts. Despite my earlier cynicism, I do wish your effort well. We are convinced to our bones the value of the Wikipedia content, unique in human history, and also believe there is much, much latent and decipherable structure within it, including its infoboxes as DBpedia has shown. But we are also convinced that the Wikipedia structure as is is significantly flawed. We'd like to be able to infer and discover across the entire Wikipedia structure, as well as to get to valuable content for specific things. Thanks, Mike [1] [2] On 4/16/2014 6:26 AM, wrote:"

There is genere = Heavy Metal but not genere = [[Heavy Metal]] Even though it doesn't find a link, the object parser could simply generate a URI from the string \"Heavy Metal\", and in the case of this template property, it would be correct, but in many other cases, it would be wrong. As a compromise, we implemented a heuristic: If anywhere on the page there is a link whose label or target (I'm not sure about the details) matches the string, we generate a URI. If the page does not contain such a link, we generate nothing. Example: [[Punk rock]], but no links for the other three genres. That's why a triple is generated for \"genere3 = Punk rock\" but not for the other template properties. Even worse - there is a link to [[Heavy metal]], but in the infobox it's spelled \"Heavy Metal\" (with a capital M), so we don't find that link. This behavior could be considered a bug. Wikipedia somehow fixes the uppercase. The page about Johnny Cash contains a link [[folk music|folk]], and apparently that's why we extract As usual, when computers try to be smart, they tend to confuse us humans. :-) Cheers, JC On Tue, May 8, 2012 at 6:53 PM, Jona Christopher Sahnwaldt < > wrote: uHere's the heuristic code: On Tue, May 8, 2012 at 7:14 PM, Jona Christopher Sahnwaldt < > wrote: u2012/5/8 Jona Christopher Sahnwaldt < >: Fixing this case bug would fix the missing property we are seeing in the Italian DBpedia, right?

In 2009 or so, we tried pretty hard to get MediaWiki to run outside of a web server, but in the end we gave up. There are too many places in the code that are tied to server APIs. We also ran a few small benchmarks that strongly indicated that HTTP is not the problem. IIRC, the HTTP overhead only took about 10% of the whole rendering time. But managing to render wikitext in Java/Scala instead of PHP would probably be a large performance boost.

Rendering pages \"like the PHP of wikipedia seems to do\" means just using their code or implementing template resolution. We've been doing the first, in that thread we suggested doing the second. Fixing this in the code has to be done carefully. The coreference resolution functionality is nice. In my opinion it should not be deactivated. When there is a link, then the object property can be generated directly. If there isn't a link, I like the idea to try to find one in the page. Also, there is some transitive closure over redirects happening down the road, and this can fix links to redirect pages. All of this is great in my opinion. I'm just reiterating this, because I haven't managed to calmly reread the whole thread, so I don't really know precisely what we're trying to fix here. Please pardon my lack of attention here.

The code should not try to be smart at all. My question is, if the mapping is hand made and trusted over the page, why in the code we trust the page (links) more than the mapping? E.g. in the Artist mapping if I says that 'genere' is genre in the dbpedia owl, I should be trusted more than the page which could not have the links. Shouldn't the mapping be the king or this could be wrong in other ways? uHi Marco, Jona, Shouldn't the mapping be the king or this could be wrong in other ways? Absolutely!!! User-generated content is our \"business\". Let me repeat, with added emphasis: \"When there is a link, then the object property MUST be generated directly FROM THE LINK PROVIDED BY THE USER. If there isn't a link FOR AN OBJECT PROPERTY, then we should try to find one in the page.\" More details Case 1: a link is provided as value. Solution: keep it as is Case insensitivity in URIs is nonsense. We should treat URIs as if they were numbers or any other kind of opaque id. Even if in Wikipedia we know that they play around with \"readable IDs\". Case 2: a link is not found, only a string. Now, for strings, case insensitivity starts to make sense. But we should be aware that it can cause errors. Perhaps having a separate dataset for \"guessed property values\" would be the safest. One exception where tampering with user provided values is acceptable: when other user-provided value corrects it. That's the case for redirects for example. So if the value of a property is a redirect page, we should point it to the end of the redirect chain. That's my opinion. Cheers, Pablo On Thu, May 10, 2012 at 5:45 PM, Marco Amadori < >wrote: uI think what Marco meant was: the mapping says it's an object property, so we should extract a URI, even if the property value is just a string. In the case of the musician infoboxes on it wiki, that would work, but in many other cases, it wouldn't. For example: Evilive\". Just that string, no links. We could use a heuristic to split the string into multiple links etc, but I don't think there's a good, clean solution. With a naive approach we would extract , which would be wrong. There is a simple rule though: If the Wikipedia template renders strings as links, then we should extract strings as URIs. Otherwise we shouldn't. The problem is that our code can't find out what the template does (well, it could, but that would be almost as hard as rendering templates). But humans can. So to implement that rule, we have to add a feature to the mappings wiki, as I described in my previous mail, so users can add a flag saying \"yes, plain string values in this property should be extracted as URIs\". It seems that Italian Wikipedia templates often work like this, while English templates rarely do. To make that behavior possible, the Italian templates use multiple properties like genere, genere2, genere3 etc, while the English templates use one property which the editors can fill with links or strings as they like.

Slightly better recall, much worse precision. I should add that that's a (strong) hunch based on my experience with DBpedia extractions and a few clicks in Wikipedia. I don't have actual data to back this claim. The Wikimedia template engine in general does not use heuristics. The specific template use heuristics, but pretty simple rules: whatever value Wikipedia users enter for one of the 'genere' properties is wrapped in '[[' and ']]', and thus rendered as a link. That's why it would make sense to allow users to add a special flag to a property mapping. Our framework should always extract the wikitext string value for one of the 'genere' properties as a RDF URI, not as a RDF literal. But for most other properties, such behavior would lead to wrong URIs. Even if the template property maps to an object property. No, see above. But only if the mapping explicitly states that this property should always be extracted as a URI. The editor of the mapping should check the source code of the Wikipedia template. If the template ALWAYS renders a property value as a link, then we should ALWAYS extract URIs for the property values. If not, then we should ONLY extract a URI for the property value if we can find a matching link somewhere on the page (that's the heuristic we use now). One more thing that may be relevant for this discussion: In the case of Template:Artista_musicale, things are even more intricate. Template:Artista_musicale calls property. Template:Autocat_musica contains a long list of musical genres and slightly different names that may be used for them, for example: |acidjazz |acid-jazz |acid jazz=[[Acid jazz]][[Categoria:{{{tipo}}} acid jazz]] This means that if a Wikipedia page contains \"genere=acidjazz\", the rendered HTML will contain a link to \"Acid jazz\". DBpedia won't be so smart. Even if we extend the framework with that special \"always extract this property as URI\" flag, DBpedia would extract the URI pretty useless, since there is no redirect from But that's a minor problem. I still think that adding that flag would be a good thing.

It's not really MediaWiki ot the template engine in general though, but specific templates. See below. others, I didn't dig deep enough to be sure). For example, this snippet from the source of Template:Artista_musicale: {{Autocat musica|genere={{{genere|}}}| passes the value of 'genere' on to Template:Autocat_musica, and Template:Autocat_musica contains [[{{{genere|}}}]] which wraps the value of genere in '[[' and ']]'. BUT if the template contains a property 'categorizza per genere = no', then different code in Template:Artista_musicale applies: {{#ifexist:{{{genere|}}}|[[{{{genere|}}}]]|{{{genere|}}}}} handles the value of the 'genere' property. It first looks for a page with that title. If auch a page exists, it renders a link. If such a page does not exist, it renders just the text. The treatment of the other 'genere2' etc properties is a bit different: {{#if:{{{genere2|}}}| [[{{{genere2}}}]]{{{nota genere2|}}}|}} If there is a value for genere2, it is rendered as a line break and a link, appending the text of an optional note. If there is no value for genere2, nothing is rendered. So, to accurately mimic the behavior of these templates the DBpedia extraction would have to do this: if ($value of property 'genere' is not empty) then if (categorizza per genere = no) then if (page with title $value exists) then extract $value as URI else extract $value as string // [1] end if else // normalize $value, e.g. 'acidjazz' to 'Acid jazz' extract normalized $value as URI end if end if if ($value of property 'genere2' is not empty) then if (categorizza per genere = no) then extract $value as URI else // normalize $value, e.g. 'acidjazz' to 'Acid jazz' extract normalized $value as URI end if end if the other genere properties are like genere2 [1] (or rather, don't extract anything, because a string is not a valid value for an obect property) There are probably other cases that I have missed Wikipedia templates are a mess:-) We SHOULD do the same as Wikipedia. Or rather, we should try to get close to it with reasonable effort. Well, I shouldn't have written always. More precisely, balancing effort and extraction precision: If the template MOST OF THE TIME renders a property value as a link, then we should ALWAYS extract URIs for the property values. Yes, it would be nice to have a feature that allows us to add such mappings to the extraction configuration. But I think the specific mappings should not be in the code, but on the mappings wiki. That of course means that the mappings wiki needs a lot of new features, probably new namespaces, etc. I'm afraid I won't even have the time to implement this anytime soon. I'm already way behind schedule, and we really need to get DBpedia 3.8 out.

This time it does not trash the triple if it does not find the link, instead the code will put the triple in another file, named like 'mapping_based_properties_ambiguous_part1' which will be analized after the end of extraction, with the help of the redirects map (which is available at the end of the whole wikipedia extration phase).

Not everyone has the powerful hardware required to do SPARQL queries against DBpedia. Weâve applied more than two years of experience packaging RDF data for the AWS Marketplace to make a product that levels the playing field to enable you do to powerful SPARQL 1.1 queries over the complete English language DBpedia with one click deployment and pricing that scales with your needs. With 168% more facts than the public DBpedia endpoint and more 73% more than our last version, the Ontology2 Edition of DBpedia 2016-04 offers a full fat, full throttle experience that is satisfying for academic, commercial and other uses â despite this considerable expansion, weâve reduced hardware requirements and pricing so that our 2016-04 edition costs from 25% to 50% less than our 2015-10 edition. What is DBpedia good for? DBpedia is a collection of facts extracted from the English language and other editions of Wikipedia and features wide-spectrum coverage of most topics that are widely known, such as persons, places, historical events, chemical compounds, products, and abstract concepts. DBpedia concepts intersect strongly with most vertical domains such as Finance, Health Care, Geospatial, Ski Areas, etc. Frequently additional work is required to make a fully functional data set relevant to a specific domain, yet, DBpedia can be the basis of a âfirst draftâ database on any almost any topic. Beyond that, DBpedia contains valuable enrichment information and can be used as a Rosetta stone between competitive and cooperative ontologies and databases. One of the most valuable forms of enrichment DBpedia can provide is multilingual information, thus DBpedia has special value for those who develop applications for the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) market where the existence of many languages poses a challenge for education, commerce and peace. Although DBpedia lends most naturally to a database, logical, or rule-based approach, the correspondence between a large database of facts and supporting text makes DBpedia a key resource for text understanding work using the machine learning methodologies that are currently popular. How does the Ontology2 Edition of DBpedia 2016-04 compare with prior versions? The Ontology2 Edition of DBpedia 2016-04 contains numerous improvements over the Ontology2 Edition of DBpedia 2015-10 and previous releases. First, the Ontology2 Edition of DBpedia 2016-04 is our best edition of DBpedia yet because DBpedia 2016-04 is the best DBpedia yet. New data sets open the way to new applications and improvements to the extraction frameworks including machine learning mechanisms improve quality in general. Compared to previous editions, our 2016-04 edition features optimized I/O and networking the AWS cloud. To avoid slow initial speed while the EBS image is loading from the snapshot, we force the EBS image to be initialized as fast as possible and only give you access when it is ready to deliver fast and predictable I/O. For the first boot, youâll need to wait about 90 minutes for it to be ready, but it is worth the wait because youâll get consistently strong performance out of the gate â assisted by numerous changes to the configuration and build process that stabilize the system, even when tackling the toughest queries. The 2016-04 edition is our first edition to use named graphs to isolate and identify 71 different data sets provided by the DBpedia Foundation. You query the union of these graphs by default, so It works like it always has, but you can also pick and choose which datasets to use for which triple patterns so you can pick between multiple points of view of facts and look at the relationships between various points of view. Weâve improved our pricing model to be a better fit for more users and align our interests with your own. With a choice between of a low hourly rate of $1.66 USD an hour inclusive of hardware and a $499/year subscription, the Ontology2 Edition of DBpedia 2016-04 is not just the fastest, but also the least cost solution for almost anyone who wishes to perform heavy SPARQL queries over DBpedia. How does the Ontology2 Edition of DBpedia 2016-04 compare to other options? Two years ago, our :BaseKB product was the first linked data machine image to be offered in a public cloud marketplace. Other brands have come and gone, but weâve produced more machine images with a more diverse range of different data products than anyone else. Weâre not funded by a research grant, triple store vendor, or cloud service provider, and we use our machine images for our own work, so weâre focused entirely on the needs of people who query or otherwise consume Linked Data. Speed of execution is critical in the world of corporations, startups, and publish-or-perish academia and the Ontology2 Edition of DBpedia 2016-04 delivers. It frees you to focus on your own unique contributions without the distraction of provisioning hardware and working with triple stores at the edge of the performance envelope. Act Now Subscribe to the Ontology2 Edition of DBpedia 2016-04 in the AWS Marketplace and you could be getting results in as little as two hours.

You can turn it off when you don't need it and save a lot of money, also you can hit a button and reset it back to factory condition if you get it in a bad place somehow. The minimum wage here in New York is $9.00 an hour and that's a low rate globally for computer operators. The hourly cost inclusive of hardware is a small fraction of that. If it is being used by a developer on a 8-hour work day, you pay for it 1/3 what you would for running it all day. The $499 annual subscription is compared to what it might cost to create something similar yourself, such as $200 for 32GB RAM upgrade to a laptop + 8 hours for planning out the process, + 4 attempts made to produce successful release at 8 hours each (4 production + 4 testing) The cost to roll your own is then $299 + $40 * R where R is the rate. You couldn't do this legally in New York for less than $560. And that's for something without extensive optimization, which comes with no support whatsoever, etc. If you bill the annual subscription to a credit card you can use it together with service credits, reserved instances and other techniques to scale out the hardware as much as you like at a low cost. I have seen people subscribe and spend about $20 to do a quick evaluation, so if you have questions it is very worthwhile for you to try it yourself at A Step-by-step tutorial that includes some interesting example queries is here: Once you have tried it out, please leave a review on the product page so people won't just have to take my word for it. uOn 11/3/16 11:03 AM, Paul Houle wrote: Paul, Nice breakdown. uOn Wed, 02 Nov 2016 11:38:58 +0100, < > wrote: uOn Thu, 03 Nov 2016 13:33:51 +0100, Dimitris Kontokostas < > wrote: uOn Thu, 03 Nov 2016 16:35:29 +0100, Kingsley Idehen < > wrote: Is that all?

While it is a shame to say 'no' to people trying to use linked data, this would be more saying 'yes, but not like that'. That's useful to know, thanks. Do you have the impression that these folk are typically trying to copy the entire thing, or to make some filtered subset (by geographical view, topic, property etc). Can studying these logs help provide different downloadable dumps that would discourage crawlers? Looking at anything discouraging crawlers. Where is the 'best practice' or 'acceptable use' advice we should all be following, to avoid putting needless burden on your servers and bandwidth? As you mention, DBpedia is an important and central resource, thanks both to the work of the Wikipedia community, and those in the DBpedia project who enrich and make available all that information. It's therefore important that the SemWeb / Linked Data community takes care to remember that these things don't come for free, that bills need paying and that de-referencing is a privilege not a right. If there are things we can do as a technology community to lower the cost of hosting / distributing such data, or to nudge consumers of it in the direction of more sustainable habits, we should do so. If there's not so much the rest of us can do but say 'thanks!', then, er, 'thanks!'. Much appreciated! Are there any scenarios around eg. BitTorrent that could be explored? What if each of the static files in were available as torrents (or magnet: URIs)? I realise that would only address part of the problem/cost, but it's a widely used technology for distributing large files; can we bend it to our needs? cheers, Dan uDan Brickley wrote: Yes. Some have cleaned up their act for sure. Problem is, there are others doing the same thing, who then complain about the instance in very generic fashion.

Our own ISPs even had to get in contact with us (last quarter of 2009) re. the amount of bandwidth being consumed by DBpedia etc For us, the most important thing is perspective. DBpedia is another space on a public network, thus it can't magically rewrite the underlying physics of wide area networking where access is open to the world. Thus, we can make a note about proper behavior and explain how we protect the instance such that everyone has a chance of using it (rather than a select few resource guzzlers). When we set up the Descriptor Resource host, these would certainly be considered. Also, we encourage use of gzip over HTTP :-) Kingsley uNathan wrote: Yes. Yes. Kingsley uDan, If I were The Emperor of LOD I'd ask all grand dukes of datasources to put fresh dumps at some torrent with control of UL/DL ratio :) For reason I can't understand this idea is proposed few times per year but never tried. Other approach is to implement scalable and safe patch/diff on RDF graphs plus subscription on them. That's what I'm writing ATM. Using this toolkit, it would be quite cheap to place a local copy of LOD on any appropriate box in any workgroup. A local copy will not require any hi-end equipment for two reasons: the database can be much smaller than the public one (one may install only a subset of LOD) and it will usually less sensitive to RAM/disk ratio (small number of clients will result in better locality because any given individual tend to browse interrelated data whereas a crowd produces chaotic sequence of requests). Crawlers and mobile apps will not migrate to local copies, but some complicated queries will go away from the bottleneck server and that would be good enough.

So all those making slides, tutorials, blog posts or software tools have a role to play here. Ok, let's take care to explore that then; it would probably help others too. There must be dozens of companies and research organizations who could put some bandwidth resources into this, if only there was a short guide to setting up a GUI-less bittorrent tool and configuring it appropriately. Are there any bittorrent experts on these mailing lists who could suggest next practical steps here (not necessarily dbpedia-specific)? (ah I see a reply from Ivan; copying it in here) I suspect BitTorrent is in some ways somehow 'taboo' technology, since it is most famous for being used to distributed materials that copyright-owners often don't want distributed. I have no detailed idea how torrent files are made, how trackers work, etc. I started poking around magnet: a bit recently but haven't got a sense for how solid that work is yet. Could a simple Wiki page be used for sharing torrents? (plus published hash of files elsewhere for integrity checks). What would it take to get started? Perhaps if download published (rdfa?), then others could experiment with torrents and downloaders could cross-check against an authoritative description of the file from dbpedia? Are there any RDF toolkits in need of a patch to their default setup in this regard? Tutorials that need fixing, etc? cheers, Dan ps. re big datasets, Library of Congress apparently are going to have complete twitter archive - see uRoss Singer wrote: I meant: the are sending a series of these query patterns with the same goal in mind: an export from DBpedia for import into their own Data Spaces.

"DBpedia Spotlight v0.5 Released (Text Annotation with DBpedia)"	"uHi all, We are happy to announce the release of DBpedia Spotlight v0.5 - Shedding Light on the Web of Documents. DBpedia Spotlight is a tool for annotating mentions of DBpedia entities and concepts in text, providing a solution for linking unstructured information sources to the Linked Open Data cloud through DBpedia. The DBpedia Spotlight Architecture is composed by the following modules: * Web application, a demonstration client (HTML/Javascript UI) that allows users to enter/paste text into a Web browser and visualize the resulting annotated text. * Web Service, a RESTful Web API that exposes the functionality of annotating and/or disambiguating resources in text. The service returns XML, JSON or XHTML+RDFa. * Annotation Java / Scala API, exposing the underlying logic that performs the annotation/disambiguation. * Indexing Java / Scala API, executing the data processing necessary to enable the annotation/disambiguation algorithms used. In this release we have provided many enhancements to the Web Service, installation process, as well as the spotting, candidate selection, disambiguation and annotation stages. More details on the enhancements are provided below. The new version is deployed at: * * Instructions on how to use the Web Service are available at: We invite your comments on the new version before we deploy it on our production server. We will keep it on the \"dev\" server until October 6th, when we will finally make the switch to the production server at If you are a user of DBpedia Spotlight, please join for announcements and other discussions. Changelog Changes since last public release (v0.1): * Uses DBpedia 3.7 resources, including types from DBpedia Ontology, Freebase and Schema.org. * New Web API method /rest/candidates provides a ranked list of candidates for each surface form. This will allow the use of DBpedia Spotlight in semi-automatic annotation (e.g. of blog posts), where users can \"fix\" a mistake made by our system by choosing another candidate from the suggestions provided by the service. * New disambiguation implementations, including a two-step disambiguator with simpler context scoring provides up to 200x faster annotation with modest accuracy loss (~7%) in our preliminary tests. * SpotSelector classes allow one to discard non-entities early in the process to improve time performance and conformance with annotation policies (e.g. do not annotate common words). * jQuery plugin for DBpedia Spotlight allows one to annotate a Web page with one line of javascript code: $('div').annotate(); * Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is now enabled by default on the Web API, allowing javascript code on your page to call our service without need for proxies. * Enhanced candidate selection stage (with approximate matching) improves coverage of candidate URIs for surface forms with small variations in spelling. * Debian packaging allows one to install DBpedia Spotlight via the package manager in many Linux distros. * Easier installation: fully mavenized process, auto-generated jars, more configuration parameters accessible via property files. * Better modularization: dependence on the DBpedia Extraction Framework was moved to module \"index\". Users that only want to run the service can now ignore that dependence. * Web API description provided via Web Application Description Language (WADL). It allows you to create clients automatically via IDEs such as Eclipse, NetBeans, etc. * Downloads: full index, compressed index, spotter dictionaries with different thresholds, etc. available from * Removed restriction on the number of characters. Beware that short texts will have lower performance since they normally provide less context for disambiguation. * Accepts POST requests in addition to GET. This allows longer text. Unless explicitly specified, long texts automatically use the Document-centric (faster) disambiguation algorithm. * A bookmarklet allows user to select text in any Web page using their good old browser and call DBpedia Spotlight directly from there in order to obtain annotated text. Acknowledgements Many thanks to the growing community of DBpedia Spotlight users for your feedback and energetic support. We would like to especially thank: * Jo Daiber for his great work on better spotters, additional types, cuter interfaces and many other improvements to the tool; * Paul Houle for the extensive feedback on the system, great suggestions for improvement and patches; * Scott White for the invaluable discussions on the architecture and other advice; * Rob DiCiuccio for his real-world use case description and PHP client implementation; * Giuseppe Rizzo for his friendly push for releasing the /candidates API and feedback on the API's design; * Thomas Steiner and Rainer Simon for opening the Known Uses list ( Cano et al., Ali Khalili, Raphaël Troncy and Giuseppe Rizzo for letting us know of their uses of DBpedia Spotlight.

This will allow the use of DBpedia Spotlight in semi-automatic annotation (e.g. of blog posts), where users can 'fix' a mistake made by our system by choosing another candidate from the suggestions provided by the service. * New disambiguation implementations, including a two-step disambiguator with simpler context scoring provides up to 200x faster annotation with modest accuracy loss (~7%) in our preliminary tests. * SpotSelector classes allow one to discard non-entities early in the process to improve time performance and conformance with annotation policies (e.g. do not annotate common words). * jQuery plugin for DBpedia Spotlight allows one to annotate a Web page with one line of javascript code: $(&#39;div&#39;).annotate(); * Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is now enabled by default on the Web API, allowing javascript code on your page to call our service without need for proxies. * Enhanced candidate selection stage (with approximate matching) improves coverage of candidate URIs for surface forms with small variations in spelling. * Debian packaging allows one to install DBpedia Spotlight via the package manager in many Linux distros. * Easier installation: fully mavenized process, auto-generated jars, more configuration parameters accessible via property files. * Better modularization: dependence on the DBpedia Extraction Framework was moved to module 'index'. Users that only want to run the service can now ignore that dependence. * Web API description provided via Web Application Description Language (WADL). It allows you to create clients automatically via IDEs such as Eclipse, NetBeans, etc. * Downloads: full index, compressed index, spotter dictionaries with different thresholds, etc. available from http://spotlight.dbpedia.org/download * Removed restriction on the number of characters. Beware that short texts will have lower performance since they normally provide less context for disambiguation. * Accepts POST requests in addition to GET. This allows longer text. Unless explicitly specified, long texts automatically use the Document-centric (faster) disambiguation algorithm. * A bookmarklet allows user to select text in any Web page using their good old browser and call DBpedia Spotlight directly from there in order to obtain annotated text. Acknowledgements Many thanks to the growing community of DBpedia Spotlight users for your feedback and energetic support. We would like to especially thank: * Jo Daiber for his great work on better spotters, additional types, cuter interfaces and many other improvements to the tool; * Paul Houle for the extensive feedback on the system, great suggestions for improvement and patches; * Scott White for the invaluable discussions on the architecture and other advice; * Rob DiCiuccio for his real-world use case description and PHP client implementation; * Giuseppe Rizzo for his friendly push for releasing the /candidates API and feedback on the API&#39;s design; * Thomas Steiner and Rainer Simon for opening the Known Uses list ( http://dbpedia.org/spotlight/knownuses ), and Rob DiCiuccio, A. Elizabeth Cano et al., Ali Khalili, Raphaël Troncy and Giuseppe Rizzo for letting us know of their uses of DBpedia Spotlight. With this release we also have the pleasure of welcoming Jo Daiber as a committer. We are looking forward to continuing this fruitful collaboration.

Apparently, you have a different notion of the term \"ontology\" - which is not surprising, given your definition which probably resembles \"the ontology is a conceptualization of the world\" has been the prevalent one for a long time. These days, a more appropriate definition seems to be \"An ontology is the formalization of a conceptualization\". The DBpedia ontology definitely fits this definition.

"Extracting audio files from Wikipedia (was: Multi-listen_item)"	"uYves, At the time of the previous extraction, there were some audio samples embedded in J.S. Bach's article page. They have since moved to their own separate page: We don't currently have an extractor for audio files. This would require a new extractor, which could be patterned after the ImageExtractor, since audio file embedding in Wikipedia uses the syntax as image embedding. I have done some preliminary investigation here: If you want to work with the audio files without waiting for a new extractor: This link should have all the information you need to reconstruct the audio file's URL.

[[Media:Johann Sebastian Bach - The Well-tempered Clavier - Book 1 - 02Epre cmaj.ogg]] links directly to the file, but since the new browser audio/video player, probably that is less common.

"Why is the OWL ontology in RDF/XML?"	"uA minor inconsistency I've noticed in dbpedia is that the OWL ontology is represented in RDF/XML, while the rest of dbpedia is in NT. I like NT.

If you do not like the blank nodes, you could perform a string replace, e.g. \"_:genid\" replaced by \" In general, an OWL axiom may require several RDF triples to represent it.

"DBpedia and Wikidata together"	"uKingsley, I am very much heartened by your response because I thought you're a die-hard DBpedia guy; and a couple months ago when Markus pointed to the excellent Resumator, you sort of said \"but does it LOD\". Wikidatians have strength in numbers. As Multichill (Sum of All Paintings, WikiCulture, WikiLovesMonuments) is just emailing me \"We have bots and we're not afraid to use them. My bot (BotMultichill) has over 4 million edits\" They're not afraid to screw some modeling up, because they're gonna fix it. They talk to each other, all the time, in sophisticated ways. (Well, not all of them are sophisticated: e.g. I am just learning) Mediawiki is the most sophisticated consensus-building platform, right? They're good with practical information architecture (things shold be easy to use and see), without being afraid of breaking some puny rule. They're not afraid to use what used to be a cursed languge (PHP). Phabricator is a great10 tools in one? I only used it couple days but the UI is excellent. And they are getting serious about RDF: they're retooling the WDQ backend because that wonderful beast is ever hungry. (They picked BigData because of free support and strong engagement). I don't quite clearly see the Complementarity between DBP and WD that you see, but there are options. What I see that there's got to be a joint series of workshops. Maybe also with the SemanticMediaWiki (or OntoWiki) people, because they have the third perspective. Who's for it? I sure would be happy: will cut down on travel :-) PS: Too bad this thread wont go to wikidata-l because I'm not subscribed there. uOn 3/30/15 7:01 PM, Vladimir Alexiev wrote: That's an example of how my comments can be easily misconstrued, due to my DBpedia and LOD proximity :) All I want is for identifiers to resolve to description documents. Net effect, we have URIs functioning as terms rather than words and/or phrases, expands the power of the Web. All good. \"A\" rather than \"The\" :) Yes! Not being afraid to break things is crucial. A system of draconian rules is DOA. That said, Linked Open Data isn't draconian, but I do empathize with those who might initially arrive at that conclusion. And that's the weak point that needs fixing. Wikidata is about a crowd oriented DataWiki for structured data. DBpedia is about Wikipedia content rendition in 5-Star Linked Open Data form. Wikidata enables DBpedia to be better. DBpedia enables Wikidata to be better, even if DBpedia shortcomings are the initial point of focus. Yes, but not just workshops. Principals behind both projects need to talk and get to understand one another, genuinely. As I said, these projects are inherently complimentary+++ Both are DataWiki variants. They are complimentary tools that can play a role. Just like related tools that offer read-write capability at Web-scale via the open standards such as LDP, SPARQL Graph Protocol, SPARQL 1.1 Update etc It's in the cc. :) Kingsley"

It was using the very old 'escape()' javascript function which does not encode the + character as a special character. It then uses that escaped string to call the real /sparql endpoint. When the /sparql endpoint decodes the &query;=XXXX3+3YYYYY string it decodes the + character as a space thereby creating a syntax error in your query. I fixed the snorql code on http://dbpedia.org to use the encodeURIComponent function which is the proper way of embedding a query as a parameter argument in a URL.

"Inconsistent results from sparql queries (David Spacey)"	"uWe (in the BBC Search team) are still seeing the problem below. To recap, Dave wrote: For example using a simple SPARQL query like SELECT ?abstract WHERE { ?abstract . FILTER ( langMatches( lang(?abstract), 'en') || ! langMatches(lang(?abstract),'*') ) } on dbepdia.org/sparql gives the abstract that you¹d expect; running it on dbpedia-live.openlinksw.com/sparql doesn¹t find it. However if you use abstract_live rather than abstract then it does find something ­ although surprisingly it finds two different abstracts! Just to be explicit, running this query SELECT ?abstract WHERE { ?abstract . FILTER ( langMatches( lang(?abstract), 'en') || ! langMatches(lang(?abstract),'*') ) } on dbpedia-live.openlinksw.com/sparql does give a result, in fact it gives two! So really I have three main questions (although any information would be useful): 1. What is the 2. Cam we safely use it instead of 3. Why does it have more than one value? We are seeing this on around 20% of the resources that we are interested in, and is preventing us from using the Live DBPedia at present. Thanks very much, Stephn.

We optimized the speed and will soon reload DBpedia 3.4 and also load all changes since September, which will fix the missing or double abstracts. Here is how it should work: Every page has static abstracts (the ones you know). These abstracts are the same as as in 3.4 and will remain static. abstract_live is the abstract extracted for the last revision. The main reason why there are two is, that there are two different responsible extractors: - A slow one, which produces abstracts with better quality and produced the abstracts for 3.4. - A fast one (factor 10-100) , which produces abstracts with more or less acceptable quality and produces comment_live and abstract_live Once we improve the speed of the \"better\" AbstractExtractor, they will be merged again, but this could take quite some time as it is a complicated and expensive process( It involves parsing Wiki syntax, extending a MediaWiki and synchronizing template definitions) Perhaps, it will even stay like that and we will only refresh the static abstract information with each available Wikipedia dump. So there would always be a live english (for now) version and a static one with better quality and for all languages. I think, it might not be the worst solution.

Of course, if we should hold off for the minute, some idea of when those bugs would be resolved sufficiently for us to use DBpedia Live would be really helpful, but I know that may be difficult to say at present.

I will get back to you next week, as I can better answer your question then. Basically, if we fix the issue that some things are not deleted properly resulting in e.g. double abstracts, we would have a more or less stable version. Then the current framework uses a basic mapping for the dbpedia.org/ontology namespace, which also has some bugs. We are testing both currently and if it is resolved, there will be a stable version. As I said, next week I can give you an estimate. Regards, Sebastian"

"Link Dbpedia and freebase relations"	"uHi, I'd like to find out which dbpedia ontology relations (e.g., birthDate) correspond to which freebase relations. Has this mapping been established, or would it have to be done manually for relations of interest? Thanks, Nicholas uHi Nicholas, there are currently only instance-level links between Freebase and DBpedia and no mapping on schema-level. Having such a mapping would be great. So, if you work into this direction, please send us your results, so that we can publish them together with Dbpedia. Kind regards, Chris uHi Nicholas, There isn't currently such a mapping, but I suspect that it would be pretty easy to generate it. Most DBpedia topics can be mapped to Freebase topics, and between any two connected topics in both datasets, there usually is only a single Freebase relation and DBpedia relation. It is straightforward to infer that these relations are the same, especially if the same relations co-occur many times across many topics. -Colin On Jun 10, 2009, at 10:45 PM, Nicholas O.

The resource i.e. 1000 triples. Kingsley et al: Is it possible to load the triples in our store but only get them when they are explicitly queried? So to exclude them from \"Select *\" queries? May I ask what you have in mind? I could prepare a dump for you with pagelink-counts, i.e. the count of incoming or outgoing pagelinks per resource. Cheers, Georgi uThe reason I was asking is that the structured wiki data (categories & infoboxes) contains usefull information, but not all. I was thinking about \"show me all cars that were in James Bond movies\" sort of queries. The relationship of a car and movie is not in an infobox, but certainly is in the text (a link); as in here: OTH, I understand the flooding problem uHi Jiri, you are right about your suggestion to solve the flooding problem on the client side, but at present we only have generic linked data browsers in place that can't do such filtering. Another reason for not loading into our triplestore was that these pagelinks are quiet poor in semantics, because they only contain the information that two resources are \"somehow\" related, but not \"how\". But the solution might be modeling the pagelinks in a slightly different way: creating a subnode like \"pagelink_collection\" that contains all pagelinks. That way our browsers are not flooded and others can query for the pagelinks. Richard: What do you think? Jiri, I'll get back to you on that tomorrow. Cheers Georgi"
"Infobox_properties and Influences"	"uHi everybody, thanks again for helping me out with my last question! My master thesis is making great progress. While working with the mappingbased- and infobox_properties files I've encountered a new issue I was wondering about. Some of the entries I find in the property files don't really seem to match with the actual wikipedia articles. For example I found that according to the infobox_properties file writer Alexandru_Macedonski influenced many other writers, but I can't find any of this information on the article on Macedonski in the english wikipedia, neither in the infobox nor in the text itself. Does anyone know why? thanks again, Christoph uHi Christoph, this is interesting. The information does not show on the web page, but if you look at the Wiki markup source code of the corresponding Wikipedia page, the information is contained in the infobox: The DBpedia extraction code uses that source code (and not the rendered HTML), so it gets access to that information. For some reason, it is not rendered to HTML, but that seems to be a Wikipedia issue, not a DBpedia one. Hth.

However, the TemplateMapping information states: The first template infobox on a page defines the type of this page, while further infobox templates will be extracted as instances of the corresponding types and own URIs. The template Infobox Automobile shall be mapped to the ontology class Automobile, while the template Infobox Automobile engine shall be mapped to the ontology class AutomobileEngine. The correspondence of the infobox template instances can be preserved by defining a correspondingClass and correspondingProperty on the Automobile instance pointing to the AutomobileEngine instance. Which means that I can't just use a TemplateMapping that contains an IntermediateNodeMapping (which was what I was trying to do, until I read the documentation). I can use TemplateMapping's correspondingClass/Property, but that inverts everything: [ Â  Â  dbpedia-owl:currentMember ; Â  Â  dbpedia-owl:squadNumber 9; Â  Â  dbpedia-owl:position \"FW\"; dbpedia-owl:team Â  ], [ Â  Â  dbpedia-owl:currentMember ; Â  Â  dbpedia-owl:squadNumber 17; Â  Â  dbpedia-owl:position \"MF\"; dbpedia-owl:team Â  ].

The actual article is I could live with if a very few articles get misparsed and contain junk like that, but it simple fails on very easy examples like \"Volvo\": \":This article is about Volvo Group - AB Volvo; Volvo Cars is the luxury car maker owned by Ford Motor Company, using the Volvo Trademark.\" Looking at the actual page ( makes it easy to see that what it should have extracted is: \"Volvo Cars, or Volvo Personvagnar, is a Swedish automobile maker founded in 1927 in the city of Gothenburg in Sweden.\" There are over 10000 articles that have got extracted like that: Another 2000 articles contain \"redirect messages such as\": \":\\"F1 1995\\" redirects here. For the video games based on the 1995 Formula One season, see F1 95.|}\"@en . Looking at the article it's easy to see that a better sentence to fetch is \"The 1995 Formula One season was the 46th FIA Formula One World Championship season\". I don't think it should be too complicated to avoid getting junk by just looking at strings such as \"redirects here\" or \"This article is about\". Does someone know if someone is working on improving on this for the next dump they gonna create. Or has someone written another better parser already that I can use (or just download the dump of what it has generated). uHi Omid, you are right, the abstracts' quality needs improvement. We have plans to have better abstracts :) But nobody is working on it at the moment or will do in the very near future. As you might know, the DBpedia extraction framework is open source, and we highly welcome contributions! You can find the Abstract extractor at ShortAbstractExtractor.php?revision=468&view;=markup If you have any question regarding the framework, please feel free to send me a message. Cheers, Georgi uI'm willing to help contributing with code to improve this feature. However I have some issues getting started running the code base. Is there any tutorial that shows step by step how one can get the project running on my own machine? I have seen with \"svn co dbpedia\". I wonder why do I need to specify a database in \"./databaseconfig.php.dist\"? What will this database be used for? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought what the program does is to read as input the wikipedia dump (for example \"enwiki-20080103-pages-articles.xml\") and output a lot of .nt files (such as \"articles_abstract_en.nt\" etc). (1) Why does this process involve a MySQL database? (2) As my first project I want to improve on the abstract extractor (dbpedia/extraction/extractors/ShortAbstractExtractor.php). I do not want to generate anything but \"articles_abstract_en.nt\", so I want to disable everything except this particular module. How do I do this? I don't want all other components to run and take time. (3) Is there any documentation for someone brand new to this project that shows with simple steps how one get started with compiling and running this. start.php, but is there any more documentation? For example: Where is the config files? Where do I specify the path to \"enwiki-20080103-pages-articles.xml\"? Where will the output be stored? I guess the answer to these questions are somewhere in the source code, but it would be nice to have a \"get started with DBPedia in 5 minutes\" kind of tutorial showing step by step what one need to do to get it up and running.

Use the LiveWikipedia Connector instead of the DatabaseWikipedia connector (line 114, start.php). Then you can specify a small bunch of Wikipedia articles to test and develop with (line 104, start.php), which will be downloaded using a Wikipedia webservice at runtime. But don't overstress the webservice, you're IP might get blocked. one request per second is ok. You'll need the mysql database as soon as you want to create a whole ntriples file with all dbpedia resources. If you don't want to do that, we can use your improved extraction code with our next dataset release. If you have any question, please don't hesitate to ask. Best, Georgi"

"question regarding retrieval of news organisations"	"uHello, I've been lurking on this list for a while, not being sure whether it's a forum intended for 'admin' or 'developer' type discussions. Over time, it seemed like it's a bit of both which is why I'm going to ask my newbie/developer question (I manage my way around SPARQL, and know a bit about dbpedia.org, mainly through this list). I'd like to look up information in dbpedia.org that's related to news sources (websites, newspapers, media organisations, blogs, etc.). My main goal is to retrieve some information about the news organisation, a bit like the Google info box (name, summary abstract, place of where it is geographically located, country of origin, date of creation, ). I understand that there certainly isn't always all the information I'm looking for. All I have at my disposal are the domain names of URLs retrieved via RSS feeds (i.e. I have no control over them whatsoever): and many hundreds, probably thousands of others. My application will take each one and send a SPARQL query to dbpedia using this 'identifier' as its initial and only data point. I cannot have specific queries for specific URLs. In theory, they seem like useful identifiers, and often enough, when I check with the English wikipedia, there is an equivalent website link in the info box, which if I'm not mistaken is the part of a wikipedia page that is getting mapped to dbpedia. However, I'm not sure to which properties these website links are mapped. Looking at dbpedia-owl:wikiPageExternalLink, dbpprop:website, foaf:homepage which all have the website's link. Is there a canonical one to use? Is there any guarantee that if there is website link in an infobox on wikipedia (let's assume I restrict myself to the English one)? Also, looking at some of the dbpedia pages (e.g. dbprop:headquarters (contains a string) and dbpedia-owl:headquarter (contains a resource which is much more useful) from where I can then retrieve information about the city and the country. Is there a recommended way of querying dbpedia using a certain set of properties rather than others? Or should one just create a lot of OPTIONAL clauses and hope to catch at least one of them? I have the impression that one cannot necessarily trust that certain information will be in dbpedia.org (not a problem, it obviously being a volunteer effort). I'm hoping, in this proof of concept, to use some sparql queries and dbpedia.org as it appears to have the richest information, but if there are other linked data endpoints that contain more/better information on news organisations across the world, I'd be very interested, if that's not beyond the remit of this discussion group. Thank you very much in advance for any help or pointers you may be able to provide. cheers, Jakob. PS: I have just discovered this page http://mappings.dbpedia.org/index.php/Mapping_Guide which might hold some answers to my questions, I guess. PPS: And here's a first throw at a query that retrieves a couple of items I'd be interested in: https://gist.github.com/jfix/cfe167ab1d5f6a84385d uHi Jacob, thanks for that interesting question! I'm copying FP7 Multisensor, since that may be of interest. Jacob's question (and ensuing discussion) can be found on: - - Not the question you asked, but: Check \"rdf:type yago:SOMETHING\" for some of the news orgs, and chances are you'll find a type that identifies most of them. - wikiPageExternalLink is ANY link mentioned in the article. If it's a host name without any path, then chances are that's the home page of the subject, but no guarantee. - foaf:homepage must be the home page of the subject, though someone may have made a mistake in wikipedia or in a mapping - also check foaf:page. It's \"any\" page related to the subject. It's a super-prop of foaf:homepage, but I'm not sure that reasoning is effected - dbpprop:website is a raw property that may be used in some wikipedia templates but not others. I think the best is to check all these methods over two sets: - news orgs identified by yago:SOMETHING - news orgs in your list of home pages dbprop is a raw property, dbpedia-owl is a mapped property. - You can find all uses of that mapped property (i.e. all maps that use it) here: - You can find other ways to explore the ontology and mapping here: - Unfortunately there's no way to restrict to English mappings only. All variations of \"mapping en\" \"ontologyproperty headquarter\" failed. Anyway, the map you want is here (but there's also \"television channel\" etc): - I checked a few wikipedia instances and all use \"headquarters\" consistently - I guess same for website->foaf:homepage Back to your question: \"dbprop:headquarters (contains a string), dbpedia-owl:headquarter (contains a resource which is much more useful)\". - yes, dbo:headquarter gets the links (because it's an ObjectProperty), dbp:headquarters gets any text - E.g. see the split in dbp:headquarters 132 (xsd:integer); 93213 (xsd:integer); Fax : 1 49 22 22 35; Tel : 1 49 22 20 01 dbo:headquarter dbpedia:Saint-Denis - the ObjectProperty extractor takes ANY link, no matter what it signifies. - are there dbo:headquarter that are not Places? Yep, there are some thousands: select * {?x dbpedia-owl:headquarter ?y filter not exists {?y a dbpedia-owl:Place}} - My favorite example is http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asheville_Citizen-Times dbo:headquarter http://dbpedia.org/resource/O._Henry I think that's a fiction newspaper devised by O.Henry ;-) - BTW, for some nefarious reason http://dbpedia.org/resource/Madrid is not a Place :-) so let's refine the query: select * { ?x dbpedia-owl:headquarter ?y filter not exists {?y a dbpedia-owl:Place} filter (?y != dbpedia:Madrid) } You may also want to check what fields are not yet mapped: http://mappings.dbpedia.org/server/templatestatistics/en/?template=Infobox_newspaper - should be interesting: 20 publishing_city, publishing_country - these may also be interesting: ISSN, oclc The description of all template fields is at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_newspaper Exactly. Adding mappings is easy, and they appear on live.dbpedia.org shortly afterwards. Try wikidata. - Pick a smaller newspaper (e.g. Chicago Defender) - It's guaranteed to be found since wikidata reflects all of wikipedia: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q961669 - But does it have an appropriate type? Yep, \"instance of=newspaper\" - Do they have the home page? Nope. That's the strength of DBpedia: extracts a lot more props, even though not always perfectly. Counting: - How many newspapers in wikidata? http://vladimiralexiev.github.io/CH-names/README.html#sec-2-1-4 (as of Dec 2014) -> 6187 Also see summary of some other counts, and a gist with all instance counts - How many in wikidata today?

"Running a periodic, automated batch of queries against a live DBpedia"	"uHello everyone! I have three questions/requests, hopefully they will be easy ones to answer/implement. First, I would like to run an automated, periodic batch of SPARQL queries against a somewhat up-to-date DBpedia endpoint, and get, at a minimum, the and properties. I am currently using the query: SELECT * WHERE { ?rel ?value . } where $title is inserted from a list of (currently) 125 articles I am interested in, making each request individually and storing the response. I had been running it against while I developed the code, but today saw this thread: and tried changing the endpoint to That server appears to be rate-limited or actively anti-automation, as I got a 503 error on the 9th request (the first 8 went through in a second or two). So, is there a place I can go to, or an API key I can obtain, such that I'd be able to refresh our Wikipedia abstracts on, say, a daily or weekly basis using fresh Wikipedia data? Again, it is a very limited set of articles I am interested in (low hundreds), so the burden on the other end would be fairly minimal, and I can schedule it to whatever time suits you. Secondly, another downside is the two live endpoints mentioned in that thread (the other being have a different set of triples from both each other and from the biannual regular DBpedia. Neither of them include the full abstract that I am interested in. Contrast: Against the very detailed: (though the lod2 one seems to be lacking in @xml:lang attributes on its non-English HTML elements!) Does anyone feel like adding these missing predicates to the live DBpediae? My third question is, all of the endpoints provide a foaf:primaryTopicOf edge pointing to the English wikipedia page â surely it should have all languages? Ideally, I would like links to each of the other language Wikipedia articles with some tie between the abstract and the wikipedia URL it came from (as there's not a 1:1 relation between ISO language codes and wikipedia subdomains, e.g. \"ChÅ«-jiÃ¢n\"@nan -> http://zh-min-nan.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%AB-ji%C3%A2n so trying to generate a URI myself using the refs:label + language code will not always work). How could this be done, and is anyone willing to do it? TBH I would be happy if the URIs were merely string literals tagged with the corresponding ISO language, though that's obviously far from ideal in terms of LOD. Perhaps both string literals and an array of (untagged) foaf:primaryTopicOf triples would be good enough. Of course I'll answer any questions that may help me get to where I want to be."
"DBpedia, Yago Class Hierarchy, and Virtuoso Inferencing"	"uJens Lehmann wrote: Jens, The current version of Virtuoso has a number of suboptimal issues relating to the initial Inference implementation that includes: Memory management issues (as you encountered) emanating from heuristics for traversing OWL class hierarchies (tree) when processing inference rules. With the fix we now start from the class hierarchy roots and traverse to the bottom of the OWL tree instead of every superclass using a dynamic hash , which grew exponentially. Thus, Virtuoso now uses a list (array of 100 preallocated elements) for a branch of the OWL tree, and when this fills up it extends dynamically. Also, it now checks for subclass definition presence in inference rules based on a hash instead of a linked list. A new Virtuoso release is imminent, the only hold up right now is the completion of Model Providers for: Jena, Redland, and more than likely Sesame. The pervasiveness of these frameworks has encouraged us to make Virtuoso play as well as can be in each of these realms. The goal is to make Virtuoso's performance and scalability features easier for these communities to exploit. Anyway, the live DBpedia has been updated. Important Note: The injection of Yago Class Hierarchy rules into the current data set is an enhancement to the current DBpedia release. Behind the scenes, there is work underway, aimed at providing an enhanced Class Hierarchy and associated inference rules using UMBEL (which meshes Yago and OpenCyc).

"Resouces in non-English"	"uDear all, I would like to ask about the resources in non-English. I've downloaded the file of Portuguese labels to use DBpedia for Portuguese. When I query the word \"Agricultura tradicional \", I cannot obtain any resouces in DBpedia. Actually, we have the information of that word in wikipedia: I think the reason I couldn't get any resources in DBpedia is \" Agricultura_tradicional \" is not written in English. Do you know how DBpedia manages those resources like that and how I can get the information of those results?

When I query the word ' Agricultura tradicional ', I cannot obtain any resouces in DBpedia. Actually, we have the information of that word in wikipedia: Tu uHello Thanh, to a corresponding article in English, that's why DBpedia does not extract any data from it. DBpedia currently only uses those non-English articles that have an 'interwiki link' to the English article, because the DBpedia subject URI is generated from the title of the English article. For example, DBpedia extracts an abstract from to the English article and generates a triple for the subject Bye, Christopher On Wed, Jan 27, 2010 at 16:43, Nguyen Thanh Tu < > wrote:"

"Literature on tracking changes in generic databases?"	"uHere's a (not so) hypothetical question. Suppose I've got some database that was populated from some data source like Freebase or DBpedia. I've got my own internal identifiers, so I can say that dbpedia:George_Washington -> mysystem:88582 fbase:/en/george_washington -> mysystem:88582 The whole reason I'm doing this is so I can make assertions about these entities. Some of these come from Freebase and DBpedia and some of them come from other places. If I look at a single moment in time, I feel like I've got this under control. I can load DBpedia version X or a freebase data dump from a particular week and it all works perfectly. Of course, at some point my data gets stale and I need to update it. For instance, there's a new batch of players who got drafted by the NFL I want to know about, or I want to know about movies that are going to be released soon, or have some vocabulary for the Fukushima muclear accident or maybe I just try to extract some facts from the latest Freebase dump and discover that a distressing number of mids have changed in the last six months. So I need some way to keep my knowledge base synced up with changes in external knowledge base(s) although I might settle for treating one as authoritative. It's not clear that there's sufficient information in DBpedia to track changes (although some renames could be tracked by following the wikipedia id's) but I think a good job can be done with Freebase: mid redirect records can be used to follow renames and merges, and at least sometimes with splits there are gardening hints that help. I can imagine heuristics that would probably work on an ad hoc basis, but it seems to me there ought to be an intellectually consistent approach to this problem. Is anyone familiar with anything in the literature on this?"

If anything, should you follow-your-nose, my demo takes you to Yago, OpenCyc and UMBEL, at each stop giving the \"bholder\" an option to explore the underlying ABox data via different \"Context Lenses\".

"Virtuoso/ DBpedia VAD wrong encoding in RDF/XML data"	"uHi, I've recieved a mail a couple of weeks ago from some users of the German DBpedia a few weeks ago who where reporting that they weren't getting any results when querying the endpoint for URIs that contained German umlauts(or any other utf8 characters). I reported the issue to the Jena mailing list and they fixed it, but in the process we also discovered a bug with Virtuoso. There is a problem with the IRI encoding in the DBpedia Internationalization VAD. Namely when querying the SPARQL endpoint the encoding of the IRIs in RDF/XML is garbled. The issue can be found in both Greek and German endpoints. For example: XML lines yo you will notice things linke simmilar issues if you look at this resource from the Greek DBpedia: This problems is that when querying the Internationalization Endpoints not only with Jena but with any other SPARQL client, the user is going to getting garbled IRIs if they contain UTF8 characters. Kind Regards, Alexandru Todor uHi Alexandru, This is a known issue and we reported it to virtuoso ~9 months ago. Unfortunatelly we use debian packages for our installation which usually are a little behind from the latest releases, so we can't say if it is fixed But, IRIs cannot be 100% serialized in RDF/XML. So even if Virtuoso fixes the encoding, the rdf might still be invalid Regards, Dimitris On Mon, Oct 17, 2011 at 6:42 PM, Alexandru Todor < > wrote: uHi Dimitris, They haven't fixed it yet since I'm using the latest Open Source version compiled from source. It is a simple encoding issue that can be worked around in java with a simple hack: output = new String(input.getBytes(\"ISO-8859-1\"), \"UTF8\"); . I don't have much knowlege about the different character sets, but I think they are encoding the UTF8 URIs in ISO-8859-1 instead of UTF8. This doesn't happen with the literal values since the UTF8 characters are escaped as ASCII. About the validity, the problem I've noticed is with the Property names, certain special characters such as brackets have to be filtered in order for it to be valid XML. I've had this issue with the German DBpedia, and as you can see right now all resourced produce valid XML and can be queries trough Sparql clients. If however there is a deeper problem with IRIs in RDF/XML that I'm unaware of, we should discuss it and push for another default serialization format for SPARQL.

BTW I need to correct the title of this mail. The issue is not with the DBpedia VAD, it is with Virtuoso itself since the SPARQL endpoint returns the same garbled results. So at this time the Virtuoso IRI handling is broken at least when using SPARQL .

Patrick uHi Patrick, Thank you. Just to specify what I mean by broken IRI support. I know IRIs work in Virtuoso quite good, better than in most other RDF Stores and it's just the RDF/XML serializer that has a small encoding bug, but RDF/XML seems to be the default serialization for SPARQL answers. People just use a common RDF framework, try to query the endpoint and get garbled results, after which they complain about the endpoint not working right. I know you can specify another serialization format like N3 or Turtle or use a small hack and get the right encoding, but I found that out the hard way as most people who try to query any Internationalized DBpedia endpoint will do.

IMDB and other URLs would be useful too, since they can be connected to users via bookmarks, link sharing mechanisms, user profiles etc. Not sure what to do about the risk of false positives though. Somewhat similar: ISBN extraction. Via million compared to the 15k in dbpedia; however these are \"mentions of ISBNs\" not necessarily pages about the relevant books. Dan uHi Dan, Yes, currently we are only extracting data and serve it on the Web. Yes, providing applications with access to the data on both sides of the link is clearly the goal, but I wonder whether this is a job for DBpedia or a job for a Semantic Web search engine like Sindice, SWSE or Falcons which crawls data from the Web and should provide apps with access to aggregated (maybe even merged and fused) data? For DBpedia our goal is to provide clean Wikipedia data and clean links pointing at other data sources. In the context of other projects, I hope to have the chance to work more on all these exciting aggregation, merging, fusion, information quality and trust problems next year :-) Still very valuable :-) As we are currently mostly doing infobox extraction we miss most of them. We might next year move to extracting all templates from a Wikipedia article and then might hopefully get more of them. Cheers, Chris"

"Lists of values in Wikipedia infoboxes"	"uFor a while now, I and other editors have been encouraging the use of HTML lists, emitted by templates {{Flatlist}}, {{Plainlist}} and {{Unbulleted list}} [1-3], which I introduced, for the inclusion of multiple values in infoboxes. The primary purpose of this is to enhance the accessibility of such content for people with visual impairments, who browse the website using screen readers. However, an additional benefit is that data reusers, including DBedia, should be able to recognise such values more easily than coma or line-break separated lists. For instance, \"Hamstead, London\" with a comma, or a line break, might refer to two distinct places, or one within an other. Marked up as either one list item, or two, the intended meaning will be clear.

"Gold Snapshot of :BaseKB a free download on BitTorrent"	"uFor a long time I've heard feedback from people who find it challenging to download large files such as the Freebase data dump and :BaseKB. That's why Gold Snapshots of :BaseKB are now available via BitTorrent By simply loading a small torrent file into a program like utorrent or Tranmission, you can efficiently and reliability get a copy of :BaseKB without the risk of data corruption. We plan to release Gold Snapshots on a quarterly basis and to indefinitely retain the data files. This is a big plus for academics, who can use Gold Snapshots for research and expect that others will be able to reproduce their results. It's also great for people who don't want to deal with the hassle of getting an AWS key or dealing with weekly updates. Since most Torrent clients provide the option to select which files you download, you can further speed things up by selecting only the files you need for a particular project. If you need access to Freebase data in the past week, you can still access this data on a requester-paid basis in AWS, and, better yet, access data in S3 directly with Amazon Elastic Map Reduce for parallel processing. :BaseKB data is compatible with industry standard triple stores; recently I found it wasn't only possible, but it was easy to load :BaseKB into Virtuoso 7.1 :BaseKB contains all relevant data from the Freebase RDF dump, but subtracts large amounts of repetitive and irrelevant information, corrects problems with literal formats, and subdivides the dump into portions such that a working database can be easily half the size of the complete Freebase RDF dump. Put this together with advances in triple store performance from the past two years, and now anybody who wants to work with Freebase data in a triple store can do so. Show trimmed content"

I've got some questions to ask the group One thing I struggled with is names of specific predicates and objects in queries. I learned that subjects are Wikipedia page names. At least for infoboxes, predicates seem to be property names and objects the property values. Where can I go to discover other subjects, predicates, and objects (categories, geonames, people, etc.)? Is there any potential value in an RDFS/owl ontology to create a directory of these? So how are other datasets (besides infoboxes) actually integrated into dbpedia? I assume they're just laid in the database; no explicit linkages other than what consistencies there happen to be between the corresponding vocabularies. Any general statistics on how consistent terms are (like between places in Wikipedia and geonames)? Are such statistics feasible? I've found it pretty easy to develop queries using the Leipzig query tool translate these statements into sparql queries. Are there simple rules for doing this? What PREFIXs are predefined for this tool?

In particular in the Yago dataset, which has been contributed externally and wasn't created with the DBpedia framework (but hey, we've got many similar bugs in datasets created by our framework ;)) Yago URIs have not been url-encoded. So as a workaround, you can url_encode all URIs starting with yago_en.nt file before loading it into your Jena model. That should do it. And we'll fix that bug for the future. Best, Georgi uGeorgi, Thanks for the reply! The problem is that loading dbpedia in an RDF store takes close to 40 hours (some RDF stores will even break), therefore I am using the DBPedia virtuoso server for now. Can you think of another solution? Thanks again, Marv uMarv, I had the same problem. You might try Openlink Virtuoso[1] as RDF Store. It performs very well. (I loaded almost the complete DBpedia datasets in just a couple of hours (on a fast server)) If you want to try it, I can send you some Unix scripts, my ini file and some hints & links. But then you could also quickly apply a hack like this: try{ QuerySolution soln = results.nextSolution() ; String x = soln.get(\"Concept\").toString(); System.out.print(x +\"\n\"); }catch (Exception e) {} which will result in a running script, but has some missing triples. Alternatively, you could retrieve the XML via http with java and then fix the XML and use ResultSetFactory.fromXML(String str), which shouldn't be so much work (not sure). I hope I could give you some options, Sebastian Hellmann [1] virtuoso uMarvin, Kingsley, On 20 Aug 2008, at 00:16, Georgi Kobilarov wrote: Actually, no. It's a bug in Virtuoso's SPARQL+XML result format serializer. Ampersands are allowed in URIs, so the Yago URIs are perfectly fine according to all the specs. (We *might* still want to %-encode the ampersand in those URIs, but just for consistency with our other URIs, not because the specs require it. That's a separate question.) The problem is: When a \"&\" character is included in content inside an XML file, it has to be written as \"&\". Virtuoso does not do this, hence the breakage. (This is a silly bug. The need to encode reserved characters (& and \") is just about the first thing a developer learns about XML. I hope OpenLink fixes this soon. Kingsley?)

"SPARQL Endpoints returns 500 Internal Server Error on some requests"	"uHi all I've noticed an odd issue with the DBPedia SPARQL endpoint which did not previously exist.

But if I use a broader accept header it returns a 500 response. The accept header in question is as follows: application/rdf+xml,text/xml,text/n3,text/rdf+n3,text/turtle,application/x-turtle,application/turtle,text/plain,application/x-ntriples,application/json,text/json,application/sparql-results+xml,application/sparql-results+json;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 This used to work fine as this is code integrated in an application which I have tested without issue in the past. The reason I want to send this broader header is that I don't know ahead of time whether the query I'm sending is a query that returns a result set (i.e. ASK/SELECT) or a query that returns a graph (i.e. CONSTRUCT/DESCRIBE) Changing the Accept Header to */* is a possible option on my side (though not ideal as I want to limit my accepted content types to those for which I have parsers) but there does seem to be an issue at DBPedia's end?

FILTER(?o LIKE ) } uHi Amir, The reasoning you want is the classic deductive reasoning using classes and subclasses. Settlement is defined as a subclass of Place (although maybe not directly). That means that all Things that are Settlements are also Places. Tehran is a Settlement, so it is also a Place. If you want to see whether some Thing is a Place, you should look at the rdf:type and reason your way up via rdfs:subClassOf and see if you end up at Place. The class Place in DBpedia has URI . DBpedia has an option \"transitive\", that can be used to make subclasses of subclasses match as well. I'm not sure that that option is part of SPARQL, so this option may not work everywhere. To select 100 items that are in a subclass of Place: select distinct ?Concept where {?Concept a ?p . ?p rdfs:subClassOf dbpedia-owl:Place OPTION (transitive).} LIMIT 100 With SPARQL ASK you can ask whether there is a match. Is dbpedia:Tehran in a subclass of Place? (DBpedia says \"true\") ASK {dbpedia:Tehran a ?p . ?p rdfs:subClassOf dbpedia-owl:Place OPTION (transitive). } But in case you're looking for something that is only defined as a Place and not as a subclass of Place, you need to know whether Place is a subclass of Place. ASK { dbpedia-owl:Place rdfs:subClassOf dbpedia-owl:Place OPTION (transitive). } says \"false\". So you want to ASK if some Thing is a Place or a subclass of a Place. ASK { { ?thing a ?p . ?p rdfs:subClassOf dbpedia-owl:Place OPTION (transitive). } UNION { ?thing a dbpedia-owl:Place . } } Replace ?thing by the URI of the Thing you want to check. I think you can construct the queries for Person and Organisation yourself :) Good luck!

In total 15 PhD students will work on that in a training network. But each student will be narrowed down on a specific challenge. We will target all aspects and challenges for launching a question answering system on Web of Data as follows: 1. Making datasets fit for question answering: - Semi-automatically cleaning and enriching datasets for question answering. - Data quality assessment. - Evaluate effectiveness and efficiency on big, real datasets. - Quality-driven dataset discovery & retrieval. 2. Translating questions into federated queries. - Query interpretation. - Query Disambiguation. - Query cleaning. - Formal query construction. - Answer type prediction. - â¦ 3. Cloud-based open question answering architecture (OpenQA) for an open Web 4. Initial training in engineering enterprise-ready software. - Evaluate in two different domains of e-commerce how easily non-experts can compose application-specific QA pipelines using the wizard. 5. High-quality interpretation of voice input and natural language text as database queries For more information you can have a look at if you are interested in a specific topic, I would be happy to share more information with you.

Thanks a lot in advance. Robert uHi Robert, dbpprop properties are a simple 1:1 mapping of Wikipedia Infobox templates properties, with no specific mapping nor special inference (I think there are only some checks on data types). On the contrary, dbpedia-owl properties are extracted from mappings of Infoboxes defined on mappings.dbpedia.org website and using the DBpedia extraction framework. Hope this clarifies a bit your doubts. I'm sure the other guys will give you more insights into the mechanism :) BR Andrea Il giorno 14/feb/2013 19:23, \"Robert Glass\" < > ha scritto: uHi Robert, On 02/14/2013 07:21 PM, Robert Glass wrote: You can find the answer of your question in that thread [1].

At the very least, since there is not many formal constraints, and that's OK, every element shoud come with a natural language definition. \"after\" is a symptomatic example of what automatic creation of ontology can lead to. When de-referencing following in the n3 file : @prefix rdf: . @prefix dbpprop: . dbpprop:after rdf:type rdf:Property . @prefix owl: . dbpprop:after owl:sameAs dbpprop:after . @prefix rdfs: . dbpprop:after rdfs:label \"after\"@en . Reading this, what do learn? Nothing, or at least nothing else than what you could infer from the use of this property in data. It's a property, OK. It's identical to itself, OK (never understood the intent of such a tautological triple) Its label is \"after\", which is I guess automatically generated from the URI (or the other way round). The only way to figure this \"after\" is going to the description of dbpedia.org/page/Adam_Smith where you find dbp:Adam_Smith dbpprop:after dbp:Robert_Graham_of_Gartmore dbp:Adam_Smith dbpprop:after dbp:Walter_Campbell_of_Shawfield You have actually to go to back to the source to figure out that this represents a succession of people in an academic office, namely \"Rector of the University of Glasgow\", which Adam Smith occupied from 1787 to 1789, preceded by Robert Cunninghame-Grahame of Gartmore, and succeeded by Walter Campbell of Shawfield. The dbpedia extraction has trimmed all this original context information, resulting in completely meaningless triples. No wonder you can't figure the meaning of \"after\".

"DBpedia ontology"	"uI have looked briefly at the DBpedia ontology and it appears to leave a great deal to be desired in terms of what an ontology is best suited for: to carefully and precisely define the meanings of terms so that they can be automatically reasoned with by a computer, to accomplish useful tasks. I will be willing to spend some time to reorganize the ontology to make it more logically coherent, if (1) there are any others who are interested in making the ontology more sound and (2) if there is a process by which that can be done without a very long drawn-out debate. I think that the general notion of formalizing the content of the WikiPedia a a great idea, but to be useful it has to be done carefully. It is very easy, even for those with experience, to put logically inconsistent assertions into an ontology, and even easier to put in elements that are so underspecified that they are ambiguous to the point of being essentially useless for automated reasoning. The OWL reasoner can catch some things, but it is very limited, and unless a first-order reasoner is used one needs to be exceedingly careful about how one defines the relations. I am totally new to this list, and would appreciate pointers to previous posts discussing such issues related to the ontology. A quick scan of recent posts did not turn up anything relevant to this matter. Perhaps those who have been particularly active in building the ontology would be willing to discuss the matter by telephone? This could help educate me and bring me up to date quickly on what has been done here. Meanwhile, Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah and Happy New Year to the members of this group.

Tom uTom, Thanks for the feedback: [TM] > You could create an ontology as it \"should\" be or you The way an ontology *should be* is the way it will be most useful to those who intend to use it. That means, it should be comprehensible and acceptable to them. As languages go (an ontology serves as a logical language), that also means that it will be the sum of the inputs of those who use it, not something imposed by some external authority. The question that I have not been able to resolve in my brief look at the DBpedia site is, just how is it anticipated that the ontology will be used? Is there an application that uses it? The application that uses it will be the ultimate arbiter of how it \"should be\". I will much appreciate a reference to actual uses in applications, where I can see how it is used and whether additional precision may be useful. I am aware of how wary people (including myself) are of those who would want to impose some ontology or terminology on a community. There is a long history of such efforts. The common resistance to using a complex system devised by others (if something simpler seems to serve as well) is one of the reasons that CYC has not been more widely adopted. In general, a big reason for the lack of wide adoption of CYC (and other \"upper ontologies\") is that people will only make effort to use another system if they have examples of uses so that they are convinced it is worth the effort; - but all significant uses of CYC and SUMO are proprietary and details are not available to the public. But there are also many examples where people *do* make effort to learn a system devised elsewhere, including linguistic systems, when useful applications can be seen. It is common even among ontologists to say that people will prefer to use their own (language/databases/terminologies/ontologies) so that no one language/ontology/database will ever be adopted universally, but we have a fine example of just such adoption of a common language - English. If you go to an international conference, virtually everyone speaks English and presents in English if they want their contributions to be understood by the largest number of people; the motivation is sufficient for people to make the effort to learn the language. And that is where an ontology can serve any community, or the whole world - in any situation where the creators of knowledge want to share it - in a precise form suitable for automated reasoning - with the whole community, however large or small that community is. As I understand it, the community intended to be served by DBpedia is the whole world. That is very ambitious, but I feel certain from my own work that it is entirely feasible to create an ontology that will be suitable for that whole world community. It does take more effort than just automatically extracting triples from a data source, structured or unstructured. Such an ontology cannot be imposed from above, it has to grow from the needs and practices of the community that uses it. But it will benefit from the large amount of work already done building other ontologies. Much of the hard work has already been done. The problem with using extracted data triples *alone* as a representation of knowledge is that, except in carefully controlled systems, they have the same problems as natural language itself - the same term may be used with multiple meanings (ambiguity) or many terms may be used with the same meaning (polysemy). Using OWL is a good step, but OWL is only a simple *grammar* for representing knowledge. Communication requires a common *vocabulary* as well as a common grammar. Triple stores created without prior agreement on terminology may still be useful for some probabilistic reasoning purposes. Automated alignment of data from different sources mostly relies on string matching to identify terms that are likely to have the same meanings in different data stores. Reasoning with such databases can generate inferences that rank results by probabilities, and they can be sent to a human interpreter who has the final decision as to whether the inferences are meaningful or nonsensical (as in a Google search). The automated alignment methods I have seen (except in very narrowly constrained domains) tend to have no more than 60% accuracy for any one pair. Automated reasoning will have chains of inferences, and any chain more than one inference in length will likely result in a conclusion that is unlikely to be true - the longer the chain, the less likely an accurate result. So if automated inferencing on data is considered desirable, very high accuracy in the representation is necessary. The good news is that such high accuracy is in fact *practical* (not merely possible), if the proper approach is used. Although different groups and different communities will insist on using their own local terminology, accurate alignment among all groups is still possible if each local community translates its own data into the common language for use by others - who will then be able to use it even if they have no idea who created the information, or for what purpose. Triple stores created by a local group may be precise if the vocabulary is carefully controlled by common agreement. For larger communities, such as that served by WikiPedia, there is little chance of gaining agreement on a single common terminology for all terms. The latter qualification is crucial. What is actually needed is not wide agreement on a massive terminology of hundreds of thousands of terms, but only on a basic defining vocabularyof a few thousand terms that is sufficient to describe accurately any specialized concept one would want to define. Learning to use such a terminology (or an associated ontology) will be comparable in effort to developing a working knowledge of a second language. In effect, in any given community that generates data, it is necessary to have at least one person who is \"bilingual\" in the local terminology and in the common ontology. This is perfectly feasible, if one has the motivation. I have been concerned with this tactic for database interoperability for a number of years. A discussion of the issue is given in a recent paper: [[Obrst, Leo; Pat Cassidy. 2011. The Need for Ontologies: Bridging the Barriers of Terminology and Data Structures. Chapter 10 (pp. 99 - 124) in: Societal Challenges and Geoinformatics, Sinha, A. Krishna, David Arctur, Ian Jackson, and Linda Gundersen, edsPublication of a Memoir Volume. Geological Society of America (GSA). (available at: If there is any prospect or hope that the formalization of knowledge envisioned by the DBpedia project will ultimately be used for automated reasoning, it is important that effort be made at an early stage to be sure that there is a proper foundation for accurate representation and avoidance of ambiguity. I can help in this task, and will be happy to do so if others in the community are willing to make an effort to do the kind of careful work required. If, on the other hand, it is expected that only probabilistic information will be extracted from queries on the DBpedia database, suitable only for inspection by potential human users, then such care in formalization may not be required. But it would still be helpful, and wouldn't add a lot of work to what is being done. The main effort is in carefully specifying the meanings of the relations being used, to avoid ambiguity and duplication. [TM] The great advantage of a volunteer community is that it doesn't take a lot of time to get funding, and the expense is mostly born by the volunteers for their own interests and their own views of what may help the public. No funder can impose a set of requirements. We *can* have a perfectly consistent database, and the effort of getting agreement on the basic vocabularyis likely to be a great deal less than is commonly supposed, because that vocabulary is not very large. The work done on DBpedia thus far appears to me to be a good start. How to proceed from here depends on the ultimate goals. I am very interested in learning how this community views its future.

Knowledge base A might be able to attain hyperprecision easily for task B, but only give the 75% accuracy that people settle for today for task C. From the viewpoint of task B, KB A is great. A \"reconciled\" database that gives 90% accuracy for both might be good enough to write a paper about but won't be commercially viable for either task B or C. Cyc inevitably gets mentioned out when the commonsense domain comes up. Even if one does accept the conventional wisdom that Cyc was a failure, the failure of Cyc doesn't mean that the commonsense domain is intractable any more than the thousands of failed attempts at flight before the Wright Brothers meant that airplanes were impossible. The adoption cost is a killer, however, and is one that will probably need to be radically reduced or eliminated if a Cyc-like product is to become mainstream. My take is that Freebase and DBpedia are an extensional approach to the commonsense domain (defining \"person\" with a long list of people and their attributes) rather than the intensional approach taken by Cyc and SUMO (does a person have two arms and two legs? is a person a member of the same species as Carl Linnaeus? is a corporation a person? In what sense is Frodo Baggins a person?) I think the extensional and intensional approaches will both be useful, but I think that computers will need a logical framework that covers everything about as much as people do. People generally don't need to think about cooking and quantum mechanics at the same time, and if somebody does, they'll invent their own framework. The only way a framework is going to be useful is if it is actually used, and a framework that \"supports\" oodles of hypothetical use cases that don't actually get used won't be usable for any of them. If that's the case, why don't you use SUMO, which is trying to accomplish exactly that? My answer would be that the vocabulary of a few thousand terms leaves you alone with the grounding problem. With a very large terminology (say the set of 3M dbpedia resources) you can, on the other hand, apply methods that work statistically, and even if you can't find the \"correct\" chain of inference you can find a large number of chains that support correct conclusions. The most direct criticism that can be made of Chomsky's linguistic program is that we've never been able to use it to transplant the \"language instinct\" into a computer. Yet. the \"language instinct\" is a facility that is part of an animal, and perhaps it needs to have an animal attached in order to work. Perhaps not necessarily a flesh and blood animal, but some kind of simulation of one. Mammals are quite good at commonsense reasoning, and if you know them well you'll discover that they're good at many of the things where Cyc tries to extend conventional logic-based systems. To make progress on \"language\" and \"vocabularies\" and such, I think it's necessary to step back and look at the primary process in which humans and animals do probabilistic commonsense inference about themselves, their environments and each other. Well, one trouble is that Dbpedia is not a database of people, places and things. It's a database of Wikipedia pages. I could let this bother me because I'm interested in the kind of ontology that the Greeks were interested in. What sort of things exist? Wikipedia's sense of what a \"thing\" is is the kind of thing that would drive any sensitive person nuts unless they decided to accept it as it is. For example, DBpedia has no concept that corresponds to \"special/exceptional\". It doesn't distinguish between \"Gingerbread\" and \"Gingerbread House\" but recognizes five or so senses of \"Gingerbread man\". It's rather hard to prove that a person or book is notable in Wikipedia but it seems impossible for a video game to not be notable. Every episode of \"Star Trek\" has its own Wikipedia page, but you'll find no episodes of \"General Hospital\". Sometimes it is hard to determine what exact \"thing\" some Wikipedia pages are about. Wikipedia's p.o.v. is not the consistent p.o.v. of an ontological engineer, but is the result of a battle between inclusionists and deletionists. It's approximately consistent because people fix obvious inconsistencies. DBpedia attains hyperprecision by being focused uJust a note on a couple of points raised by Paul Houle: [PC]>> What is actually needed is not wide agreement on a massive terminology of hundreds of thousands of terms would [PH] If that's the case, why don't you use SUMO, which is trying to accomplish exactly that? No, that was not the intended purpose of SUMO, a project in which I participated. SUMO could be used as a starter ontology to create the required inventory of semantic primitives, but would need supplementation. Closer to the required ontology is the COSMO ontology (see OpenCyc, SUMO, BFO, and DOLCE, along with other elements not contained in any of those. The COSMO has ontological representations of all of the words in the Longman dictionary defining vocabulary, which are used to create the dictionary definitions of all of the words in the Longman dictionary. Analogously, for any given set of specialized ontologies used in different applications, there will be some set of primitive elements sufficient to create the logical specifications of all of the elements in the domain ontologies. The COSMO is intended to contain all of those primitive elements, and to be supplemented as needed if new primitives are discovered. But I am assuming that the ontology for DBpedia will necessarily develop from the interests of the contributors. It takes effort to find relationships among different domains and to reconcile different viewpoints, but that task can be made more efficient, and the product more accurate by identifying the semantic primitives used in common. It appears, from what I have read about DBpedia thus far, that some effort has already been made to reconcile different terminologies in porting the infobox data into the common data store. That is a very good start, but examining the ontology shows that a lot more work is needed. One thing I am trying to learn is, exactly how is the DBpedia being used. Those uses will determine how the ontology might be modified to be more effective. [PH] >> The only way a Yes, and that is why I want to learn how the DBpedia ontology is being used. [PH] >> Wikipedia's p.o.v. is not the consistent p.o.v. of an ontological Yes, the Wikipedia itself may have inconsistencies, but it is intended for use by people who may be able to interpret the linguistic phrases in their proper context. The ontology, however, does not have to have that problem. Wherever there are inconsistent theories, they can be represented in the ontology as different theories, which do not have to be logically consistent (the CYC \"microtheories\" are one example). The base vocabulary of logical primitives, however, will be consistent, and the same vocabulary of primitives will be able to logically describethe different theories so that the differences will be precisely recognized. To give a trivial example, one can state proposition [A] and proposition [not A]. If \"A\" is definable by the inventory of semantic primitives, then both of these inconsistent theories can be represented by the same consistent ontology. The point here is that the DBpedia ontology canhave a logically consistent representation of all of the information in the Wikipedia infoboxes, and that information can be used for precise automated reasoning. It is not as difficult as it may appear to accomplish this, but it does require that one make the effort. If, however, none of the DBpedia users wants to use the DBpedia for precise reasoning, then the extra effort may be superfluous. That is why I would like to hear from people who are using the DBpedia ontology. [PH] >> My answer would be that the vocabulary of a few thousand terms You have a \"grounding problem\" regardless of the size of the vocabulary. Finding the defining primitives merely allows one to identify the minimum set of concepts that need physical grounding. Statistical methods do allow, in theory, arbitrarily precise results, provided that one has a near-infinite set of correlated examples for precisely those cases one wants to correlate. I don't believe that the structure of the Wikipedia or of DBpedia fit those criteria, but would be quite fascinated if any user has an example of such statistical usage.

Many Wikipedia pages do not have infoboxes and hence the corresponding instances lack any genuine class. The advantage of this approach is that it is fairly accurate. YAGO, in contrast provides several classes for almost all instances with a Wikipedia page, but it is a bit less accurate. The class hierarchy contains many thousands of classes derived from WordNet, which of course is suboptimal in some ways from an ontological perspective. The YAGO-SUMO project aims at replacing the WordNet upper-level of YAGO with one based on SUMO. There have been approaches published on how to recognize Wikipedia pages that describe classes rather than individual instances. So far, however, such work has not made its way into DBpedia, which treats every page as describing an instance. People frequently use DBpedia and YAGO as ontologically enhanced databases that allow for join queries of the sort \"Find me all companies founded in the Bay Area in the 1960s\". The ontology is used to make sure you match all relevant subclasses of COMPANY. The YAGO2 demo paper has a screenshot [1] showing how you can visualize the results.

This may be a good example to discuss the effects of changing to \"type\" relation to \"subclass\" as it is used for the biological taxonomy. The type relation appears to be used in the same sense that the rdf:subclasOf is used in other OWL ontologies. In the usual usage, if X has type Y, then X is an individual in the class Y, not a subclass. But in the ontology and its associated applications, to determine the parent classes (at some levels) one apparently needs to use the \"type\" rather than subclass relation (i.e. \"Albatross\" is usually a subclass, not an instance of \"Bird\"). It also appears that the subclass relation is not propagated up the hierarchy, as it should be for a transitive relation. It is not clear whether these usages were simply a mistake that has propagated, or a variant definition of these relations that was intentionally adopted for some reason. Whatever the reason, I am thinking of the following experiment: Replace the \"type\" relation with \"subclassOf\" in the DBpedia mappings and ontology where it is appropriate, and add in triples that propagatge the \"subclassOf\" up the hierarchy. Then what would happen to the faceted browsing application? I am guessing that the application assumes that the \"type\" relation will be used in the sense of \"subclassOf\" in the ontology mappings, and the results would be quite different from what happens now - and I presume, not what is expected or intended. If this is the case, then the application would have to be modified to use \"subclassOf\" instead of \"type\", to get the intended results. Would this be a major effort to make this change? I start with this suggestion because the unexpected usage of \"type\" and \"subclassOf\" is one of the more striking (to me) examples of how the ontology appears to be in error. Since the hierarchical \"subclassOf\" relation is one of the most important relations in an ontology, I would hope that that relation be used accurately, before other aspects of the ontology are modified.

That does answer part of the question I had. This still leaves me wondering whether the DBpedia ontology is being intentionally kept small (rather than representing all of the classes described in Wikipedia) for performance reasons, or because the effort of trying to make the ontology accurate while expanding it substantially is too large for the existing team. If the latter, perhaps I can help in that task. If there are performance issues, I would like to get more detail to see just how serious an expansion of the ontology would be for the existing usages. The other issue raised by the discussion in the FAQ at the GoodRelations page you cited is - just what should the semantics of a Wikipedia article be? At present, the \"type\" relation is used, and that make it appear odd for traditional ontology structure, when the Wikipedia article describes a class of things rather than an individual. It seems (to me) that it would be more appropriate to use a relation of the type \"isaDiscussionOf\" (where the main topic of the article is exactly the same as the intended class of the Wikipedia), or \"isaDiscussionOfaSubtypeOf\" where there is no corresponding DBpedia ontology entry for that class, but the class described can be related to a broader class in the ontology. The \"type\" relation might still be used, but to be consistent with the notion of Wikipedia articles being discussions rather than the individuals described it might be better to use a relation such as \"isDiscussionOfanInstanceOf\" to point to the class of the entity discussed. Then, the articles would all have the semantics of articles rather than of the entities described by the articles. I do recall someone (not sure who) mentioning that this issue of the proper semantics for articles has been an issue, but I don't recall in what context. I suppose it may well have been a hot topic for the DBpedia community at some time. I apologize that I am quite new to this community, so do not know the history. But unless there are performance issues that are truly insurmountable, it seems to me not to be difficult to get the semantics right so that the ontology can grow to accurately reflect properties and relations of the entities discussed by Wikipedia. And I will be willing to help in that task. Or is this a task that has consciously been left to the GoodRelations group?

Note that the DBpedia ontology does not aim to be an ontology for everything and before we introduce a new class/property we try to find if the same functionality can be served from existing ones. For instance, the new class JapaneseRailwayStation could be served from RailwayStation unless there exists so many railway stations in Japan that can justify its existence. Even so, we could conclude the location of a railway station from other location like properties ( country, region). You introduced Gymnast (which is an ancient greek word for coach) and Volleyball coach on the same level. Although I am Greek, I'd choose coach for naming :) and place volleyballCoach as a subclass (or maybe stick with just coach) You introduced a lot of soccer and football classes without any comments, I guess you know the difference between soccer and football in Europe and US You also made a lot of range/domain changes without explaining anything on the change log / talk pages I didn;t look much into the new properties but a few catchy ones I spotted are the new Mass* properties We already handle weight/mass a different way, you can look at for an example case. So you could delete these properties and and use this way intead Anyway, I didn't go into detail for every edit you did the last days but I'd try to be more carefull as every change you make affects the DBpedia in total both long term and immediatelly (through DBpedia live) Best, Dimitris uHi Andrea, I don't want any specific action from you, just use the above comments and review your edits so far. I am sure that most of them are already in the right direction Just note that if you move a page, you'll have to delete the created redirection, otherwise they will exist both in the ontology please see inline for your questions On Mon, Dec 24, 2012 at 2:30 PM, Andrea Di Menna < > wrote:"

""Find in Sindice" link on DBpedia pages?"	"uHi all, As some of you already know, I'm a member of the Sindice team at DERI Galway now, and I'm exploring possible synergies between DBpedia and Sindice. Here's the first idea. In the footer of each DBpedia page, there are currently a bunch of utility links: - As N3 - As RDF/XML - Browse in Disco - Browse in Tabulator - Browse in OpenLink Browser How do you feel about adding another one? - Find in Sindice Sindice ( documents that mention a certain URI. The \"Find in Sindice\" link would go to the results of a search for the current DBpedia resource's URI. The effect is that we can discover backlinks from other datasets into DBpedia. For example, if Revyu links into DBpedia, but DBpedia does not link into Revyu, then Sindice helps us to find this link from within the DBpedia page. At the moment, Sindice's coverage is still fairly narrow (just a few large datasets), so it won't produce too many useful results at this time, but this will improve over the next few months. What do you think? Any objections? Richard"

"Automating DBpedia queries with live data and abstracts"	"uHello everyone! I have three questions/requests, hopefully they will be easy ones to answer/implement. First, I would like to run an automated, periodic SPARQL query against a somewhat up-to-date DBpedia endpoint, and get, at a minimum, the and properties. I am currently using the query: SELECT * WHERE { ?rel ?value . } where $title is inserted from a list of (currently) 125 articles I am interested in. I had been running it against and tried changing the endpoint to That server appears to be rate-limited or actively anti-automation, as I got a 503 error on the 9th request (the first 8 went through in a second or two). So, is there a place I can go to, or an API key I can obtain, such that I'd be able to refresh our Wikipedia abstracts on, say, a daily or weekly basis using fresh Wikipedia data? Again, it is a very limited set of articles I am interested in (low hundreds), so the burden on the other end would be fairly minimal, and I can schedule it to whatever time suits you. Secondly, another downside is the two live endpoints mentioned in that thread (the other being Contrast: Against the very detailed: (though the lod2 one seems to be lacking in @xml:lang attributes on its non-English HTML elements!) Does anyone feel like adding these missing predicates to the live DBpediae? My third question is, all of the endpoints provide a foaf:primaryTopicOf edge pointing to the English wikipedia page â surely it should have all languages? Ideally, I would like links to each of the other language Wikipedia articles with some tie between the abstract and the wikipedia URL it came from (as there's not a 1:1 relation between ISO language codes and wikipedia subdomains, e.g. \"ChÅ«-jiÃ¢n\"@nan -> http://zh-min-nan.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%AB-ji%C3%A2n so trying to generate a URI myself using the refs:label + language code will not always work). How could this be done, and is anyone willing to do it? TBH I would be happy if the URIs were merely string literals tagged with the corresponding ISO language, though that's obviously far from ideal in terms of LOD. Perhaps both string literals and an array of (untagged) foaf:primaryTopicOf triples would be good enough. â Nicholas. uOn 10/2/14 12:18 PM, Nicholas Shanks wrote: You should be able triangulate your way to canonical data, across these data spaces, by way of relevant relations (e.g., owl:sameAs, in the worst case).

Conclusion, you don't lose the canonical DBpedia HTTP URI for a given entity. That should remain the focal point of your references and queries in regards to SPARQL when using . uHi, I am the principal maintainer of the endpoints provided by OpenLink. There are two live Dbpedia endpoints at this time: Both of which have rate limiting to curb over-enthusiastic use by a single IP address. Note that at this time the service provided by OpenLink accepts higher connection rates. This does not mean that you can just query an endpoint and bombard it with requests without taking a few precautions. First and foremost since your requests are to the /sparql endpoint using the HTTP protocol, you could and should check the HTTP status requests to make sure your query actually executed successfully. Your code could easily check for a 503 and do the appropriate thing by sleeping an arbitrary amount of time (say 1 min) and try the same again, which in most cases would return a result as the block is lifted. There are other HTP status codes you should probably check too. Secondly since you state you only want to do this 'periodically' you could also just sleep 1 seconds between each query. Since your service seems to be a background lookup, this would ensure you never hit a rate limit either. I checked our systems and our endpoints allow at least 20 requests per second from a single IP address. Should this be impossible for your service, please contact me and i can see what we can do. We are currently looking into this will see if we can add some extra static datasets for existing articles. Note that the various endpoints have different versions of the DBpedia data: lod2.openlinksw.com dbpedia 3.9 This server is scheduled for a reload soon and will load the dbpedia 3.10 / 2014 data dbpedia.org dbpedia 3.10 Data from Wikipedia dump april/may live.dbpedia.org dbpedia 3.10 + updates Up to date with latest page updates from Wikipedia dbpedia-live.openlinksw.com dbpedia 3.10 + updates Up to date with latest page updates from Wikipedia I will discuss this within the dbpedia live team. Patrick uWhat we provide in this case are owl:sameAs links to other dbpedia language editions. Then you can either dereference the uris to get their abstracts (not available in all languages) or construct the wikipedia url by replacing ' dbpedia.org/resource' to 'wikipedia.org/wiki' Using rdfs:label for this is not recommended. You can get additional labels for the same resource from other extractors that do not match the page name. Dimitris"

If you have ideas for reforming the category structure at Wikipedia then feel free to try, but you won't get a result there without a lot of effort. SemWeb ventures that attempt to do too much already get laughed out of town, but DBpedia seems to have struck a balance, due mostly to the effort by all of the volunteer editors at Wikipedia (although the transformation to RDF definitely takes another level of effort to maintain). Trying to maintain a different category structure in DBpedia to that in Wikipedia is bound to fail due to this reliance on the Wikipedia editors to maintain the millions of different subjects in the way they know best. uPeter Ansell wrote: Well, the dbpedia ontology already has concepts in it that don't seem to exist (in concrete form) inside Wikipedia. For instance, Wikipedia doesn't have well-defined categories for \"Person\" or \"Automobile Model\", instead it's got this network of categories like and then you've got those awful List pages Simply by creating a category like \"Person\" that doesn't really exist in wikipedia, the dbpedia ontology is already going beyond simply reflecting wikipedia and towards interpreting it.

""live updating", tracking resource changes"	"uGreetings DBPedia people, I'm looking forward to DBPedia getting the \"live updating\" feature (what are you calling it? the feature whereby the dbpedia datasets are updated in nearly real time as changes are committed to Wikipedia?). One thing is unclear to me, however: if resource X is changed to resource Y, will there be any explicit mechanism for discovering that, in both directions, after the fact? Obviously there's 'X Y', but I suspect that that won't be sufficient and reliable.

Maybe you could give some examples of what you had in mind when you said this might not be sufficient or reliable? Kind Regards, Claus Stadler uHi, The solution with redirects relies on someone setting a redirect in Wikipedia when an article is renamed. I'm not sure if there's a mechanism in Wikipedia to automatically create a redirect whenever an article is renamed. If there is one, then querying for a redirect would be sufficient, otherwise it wouldn't. Best, Georgi uHi Claus, Thanks for your reply. I guess I worry that there's no distinction between a redirect caused by a page being moved and a redirect for other reasons (redirects do appear for other reasons I assume?). So if I want to find all the past identities of resource Y, I can't. Now that might not actually be a big deal, I just want to clearly understand what's possible.

Minor diversion: if a page is renamed a second time, the redirect from the original page is not automatically updated: the guide advises editors to fix those links themselves. But even if individual editors fail to do so that shouldn't be a problem as long as the chain of redirects still exists we can follow them to get to the latest incarnation.

"Linguistic popularity of a resource in Wikipedia and DBpedia"	"uHello all I would like to add to the Lingvoj Ontology [1] a couple of properties enabling to make explicit and easy to query the \"linguistic popularity\" (not sure it's the best word for it) of a resource, singularly in DBpedia. What I mean by that is the set of languages in which a given DBpedia resource has a WP version. This information is generally not completely available, and not easy to extract, from the current DBpedia description. There are generally more of such languages than the ones used for labels and comments in the DBpedia description, and even those are not obvious to extract from the page. Looking for example at my place in DBpedia [2], I find that is is named and commented in 12 languages, but the source WP article [3] has 26 interwiki links, meaning it's described in 27 linguistic versions of WP. Without asking DBpedia to gather labels and descriptions in all those languages, it should be easy to fetch this language list from the interwiki links in the page, and include that in the description of the resource. The size of the list is also a good indicator of the popularity of the topic. I see a lot of applications for having such information available, either for Wikipedia editors (which resources in such category are not yet translated in my language, etc) or data users. What I propose would be to add the following to the Lingvoj Ontology @prefix : :wpLanguage a rdf:Property rdfs:range :Lingvo ; rdfs:label \"available Wikipedia language\"@en ; rdfs:comment \"The language of a Wikipedia version in which the subject resource is described\"@en. Values of this property could be either instances of languages defined in DBpedia, or more standardized values such as those defined by lexvo.org For instance : :interwikiLanguage < And for the linguistic popularity :wpLanguagesNumber a rdf:Property rdfs:range xsd:positiveInteger rdfs:label \"number of Wikipedia languages\"@en; rdfs:comment \"The number of languages in which the subject resource has a Wikipedia article\"@en. Comments welcome before I add those properties. Bernard [1] [2] [3] Guillestre"

Cheers and thanks in advance, Bina uHi Sabine There is no need for your new ontology class \"Water\". The class BodyOfWater already represents this general class for water areas. For the Atoll mapping you need a ontology property for a BodyOfWater in that the Atoll is located.To make this clear you should name the ontology property locatedInBodyOfWater. That would look like this: {{ObjectProperty | rdfs: = locatedInBodyOfWater | rdfs: = ex. an ocean is a water | rdfs: = GewÃ¤sser | rdfs:domain = place | rdfs:range = BodyOfWater }} But the easier and more abstract way is to take the locatedInArea ontology property that already exists. Sorry, you couldn't understand it because this is a mistake. The domain should be Place. Another example: The domain of your OntologyProperty archipelago should be the new ontology class \"Atoll\" an the range could be a \"Archipelago\" class. If there is no class like that and you don't want to create it, leave out the range property. The range is set to owl:Thing by deafult (the same for the domain). {{ObjectProperty | rdfs: = archipelago | rdfs:domain = Atoll }} Regards, Paul uWhoops, sorry, this didn't go to the list"

"values of "dbpedia-owl:wikPageDisambiguate" - how are they extracted"	"uHi all I have a possibly naive question but I am not able to find the answer elsewhere. My task is to extract candidate concepts/entities for an ambiguous term from dbpedia, e.g., \"cat (disambiguation)\". To do so I am looking at the \"dbpedia-owl:wikPageDisambiguate\" field for the dbpedia page: against \"en.wikipedia.org/Cat_(disambiguation)\". I would expect to see more or less all candidates listed on the Wikipedia Disambiguation page to be covered by the dbpedia field \"dbpedia-owl:wikiPageDisambiguate\", however there is quite large discrepancy - out of which the most odd one is taht the candidates on the dbpedia page do not even include the animal sense of \"cat\", and in fact it is included in \"wikiPageWikiLink\". I wonder how exactly does dbpedia extract candidates from wikipedia \"disambiguation\" pages? It is clear to me that some filtering has been done but it is not clear what it is. According to the dbpedia source code documentation in \"extraction_framework/core/src/main/scala/org/dbpedia/extraction/mappings/DisambiguationExtractor.scala\" which says \"Extract only links that contain the page title or that spell out the acronym page title\", it should selects many candidates that are currently missing in the \"wikiPageDisambiguate\" filed, but now in the \"wikiPageWikiLink\" field. Can any one shed some light on this please? Thanks! uOn 23.05.2012 11:44, Ziqi Zhang wrote: My answer is indirect - do you think that disambiguation pages are the best place to look for the different meanings of a given term?

Check out DBpedia spotlight paper [1] or Wikipedia Miner [2] which use this approach. Cheers, Aleksander [1] [2] link with Wikipedia concerns the disambiguation in great detail). uThanks for your quick reply and the pointers. I suppose you do use the Wikipedia disambiguation page to look for candidate senses of a term, considering it as a sense inventory in general. Whether you should use the dbpedia disambiguation page as an alternative I dont know, since it is related to my question and my observation that it is not a 100% mirroring of the wikipedia version. While both [1] and [2] deals with sense disambiguation, it is not clear how they select \"candidate senses\". in [1] \"We use the DBpedia Lexicalization datasetfor determining candidate disambiguations for each surfaceform.\" and by refering to the spotlight webpage \"(Wikipedia) Disambiguations provide ambiguous surface forms that are 'confusable' with all resources they link to. Their labels become surface forms for all target resources in the disambiguation page.\" - which suggests that dbpedia also uses the Wikipedia \"disambiguation page\" to look for candidate senses of a term, but perhaps some \"filtering\" strategies are used; in [2] candidate spotting is not discusssed. As to my question, I am curious in how a \"disambiguation page\" in wikipedia is converted to a dbpedia page, such that in a lot of cases, many candidate links on the wikipedia page (e.g., \"wikipedia/wiki/Cat_(disambiguation)\") are not included as disambiguation candidates on the corresponding dbpedia \"disambiguation\" page (i.e., \"dbpedia.org/page/Cat_(disambiguation)\".

It's true that the other approach clearly has certain advantages but also possibly extensive computational overheads. In my case i am considering other tasks rather than WSD, say determinig the degree of synonymity of two words, where no contexts are given for disambiguation. Typically one evaluates this by looking at the possible senses for each term - in theory I can also take the whole knowledge base as the possible candidate sense inventory regardless of what are listed on the \"disambiguation\" page but that seems to be lots of computation and impractical.

If you look at the split_to hint properties in Freebase, you can find Wikipedia articles which were split into separate concepts after import. Tom p.s. As far as computational complexity goes, none of the things being discussed strike me as being computationally infeasible unless you are on a very, very limited budget. uHi, the DBpedia data [1] was extracted from an old version [2] of the Wikipedia page. That's probably the main reason for the discrepancy with the current Wikipedia page [3] you observed. For example, that version contained a link to [[domestic cat]]. DBpedia only extracts disambiguation links that contain the disambiguated word, and the case must also match. In this case, the disambiguated word is 'Cat', but the link contained 'cat', so it was not extracted. I just changed the DisambiguationExtractor to use case-insensitive matching. That should let us extract a few more correct disambiguation targets in the next release without adding too many wrong ones.

Occupation Deputy campaign manager for President [[Barack Obama]]'s 2012 reelection campaign. dbpedia-owl:occupation dbpedia:Barack_Obama This seems a general extraction errors and also exists for other wiki pages. Two more examples: 1. Britney_Spears extracted as notable work instead of her song * [[Britney Spears]] - \"[[Touch of My Hand]]\" dbpedia-owl:notableWork dbpedia:Britney_Spears 2.

You mention dbprop:viaf, but not how it came into being. I can now answer my previous question: after another look at the wiki [2], I think \"viaf\" and \"lccn\" must have been properties in an infobox template before the Authority control template was introduced.

(2) If I execute the following query: SELECT (COUNT(?s) AS ?c) WHERE { ?s rdfs:label ?label .

If I remember well, skos:subject was removed from the spec on the very argument that SKOS should not specify how concepts should be used for indexing, letting this to metadata specifications such as Dublin Core. And singularly dcterms:subject was in the radar. Should not be to difficult to change.

The author of that mapping probably thought this means that the property `firstAscent` should apply to `Mountain` or `Volcano`.

Eg in the above case, any subject will be inferred to be both `Mountain` and `Volcano`. Furthermore, the ontology generator doesn't emit two classes, but one invalid class URI: ``` dbo:firstAscent rdfs:domain ; ``` 2) Some subProperty statements have an object spelt in Uppercase. - in some cases this leads to a statement that does not connect to the intended property (in this case dbo:medalist), e.g.: ``` dbo:silverMedalist rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:Medalist ``` - in other cases it leads to a statement which links to a class, which is a mistake ``` dbo:senator rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:MemberOfParliament . ``` Out of 62 subProperty declarations, 20 have this problem: dbo:bronzeMedalist rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:Medalist . dbo:codeLandRegistry rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:Code . dbo:codeMemorial rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:Code . dbo:distanceToCapital rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:Distance . dbo:dutchMIPCode rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:Code . dbo:goldMedalist rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:Medalist . dbo:iso6391Code rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:LanguageCode . dbo:iso6392Code rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:LanguageCode . dbo:iso6393Code rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:LanguageCode . dbo:musicalKey rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:Type . dbo:officialSchoolColour rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:ColourName . dbo:otherWins rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:Wins . dbo:politicGovernmentDepartment rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:Department . dbo:protectionStatus rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:Status . dbo:rankingWins rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:Wins . dbo:senator rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:MemberOfParliament . dbo:silCode rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:LanguageCode . dbo:silverMedalist rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:Medalist . dbo:subTribus rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:Tribus . dbo:superTribus rdfs:subPropertyOf dbo:Tribus . 3) I'm not sure whether it's a good idea to have classes and properties that have the same name, except capitalization.

"Community coordination action: DBpedia reproducubility / Dockerization"	"uHi Everyone, During the last DBpedia meeting, we decided to create a community coordinated action for making the DBpedia SPARQL endpoint reproducible. After a little brainstorming we came up with the following goals: - with each release create docker images - spread the docker images over servers from the community - keep a lit of all endpoints on the DBpedia website, first manually, then automatically updated Option 2: Community crowd-sourcing, i.e. uptime can be improved when we take off the heaviest users. For example, packaging DBpedia in docker and offering an easy way for configuration should help potential exploiters to do it on their own infrastructure, thus freeing resources to incidental (and less skilled) users. First steps are to create a list of public DBpedia endpoints and an official tutorials on setting up a DBpedia mirror. - scientific reproducibility -> for therefore Docker images As decided at the meeting, JÃ¶rn Hees will lead this action but we also identified some members that have done work in this field like Natanael Arndt, Markus Ackermann, Ritesh Kumar Singh and Kay Muller (in cc) *Next steps( - Everyone (as well as other community members that we didn't include) will present their work here - We will create a task force lead by JÃ¶rn and work on the above (or new) goals Looking forward to getting everyone's input here Cheers, Dimitris uHi, thanks to Dimitris for the introduction. As mentioned, i'm happy to coordinate the efforts to improve reproducibility of the online DBpedia endpoint. My background on this: I've been running a local Virtuoso Linked Data endpoint for our research group for quite some time now. Amongst others, we develop learning algorithms for Linked Data and they perform tons of mean SPARQL queries. Running these against online endpoints would disrupt their service and isn't really fair-use. So local mirror it was and as DBpedia is pretty interesting for us as glue for many datasets, i've always tried to keep up with the latest releases and host them locally. I started documenting this in form of line-by-line bash HowTos publicly, i think back with DBpedia 3.5 and updated the guide a couple of times. Over the time the process became easier, but it's still not what i'd call \"simple\". More than 200 monthly readers of each of my guides indicate that we should make this easier. In the latest revision of the guide, i also started dockerizing stuff, allowing me to quickly switch between different database snapshots for evaluations: Coming from this background, I fully agree with the goals that Dimitris mentioned. To kick things off, i already created a small overview document for the first \"phase\" reproducibility: You're invited to edit, discuss and get involved. Cheers, JÃ¶rn uThe availability of DbPedia as a virtuoso DB file was really helpful for me. I hope this feature will still be maintained on the long run. (And the fact that linkedgeodata was just one namedgraph away was also pretty cool!) EnvoyÃ© de mon iPhone uHi Olivier, Yes, that was an (inofficial) option that i offered in the past (simply a compressed backup of the whole Virtuoso DB directory directly after import). Unlike the docker approach it doesn't bundle a fixed Virtuoso version with the DB, so you'd need to install Virtuoso on your own. While the main focus here is make reproducibility very easy (so same data and executable as at release time), there are scenarios in which it's desirable to run an old DBpedia version with a newer Virtuoso version than at release time (think of SPARQL 1.1). So maybe we should also have a look at how to ship a DB version. As the DB snapshot is however very easy to extract from a docker image (probably a volume anyhow), I think this could be an easy addenum on top of (or as part) of the dockerization efforts. Best, JÃ¶rn uHi everybody, here is some summary of what we did so far: at SEMANTiCS 2015 we've presented dld: dockerizing linked data [1]. The idea of this was to provide a tool that basically creates docker-compose setups to easily create an infrastructure for serving RDF datasets via a SPARQL endpoint or other applications like OntoWiki. We've followed the principle of having one container per service, so we didn't want to put the complete stack including the data into a single container (Microservices [2], Single Responsibility Principle [3]). To achieve this we have identified three (or four) tasks in a setup: (1a/b): load and back-up data, in case of DBpedia, there would only be loading data (2): storage of the data (3): presentation, exploration and editing data This idea is meant to be very generic to cover different types of setups dealing with RDF data or data in general. For the case of DBpedia and also to achieve a \"scientific reproducibility\", as Dimitris mentioned, we might have to rethink this setup. Further I think also in the docker community best practices have evolved. We should also keep an eye on performance of services running in the containers vs. running them \"natively\" on a system, we have experienced some impact here already, but this might differ from setup to setup.

"indexing DBpedia with Swoogle; biological data in DBpedia"	"uHi Joel, This would be great :-) The dataset is pretty well interlinked over the different category systems and over people who work in different areas and life in the same place. So, my guess would be, if you start with a bunch of URIs from different areas and dereference any URI you are getting in the results, you should get pretty good coveradge. Maybe take the ones from There are around 1.95 million things in DBpedia and it would really be interesting to know how many you get with this approach. It would also be interesting to know how many descriptions you get through following the RDF links into the external interlinked datasets. My guess would be alltogehter maybe 4-5 million. So, please try! This is really exiting! How many URIs does your crawler dereference per second? OpenLink is pretty optimistic about the stability of the server, but maybe you should not try too many at once. Kingsley: Do you have an idea how many crawling requests the server can take per second? Yes, the problem with this boxes is that they do not use infobox template, but that many of them are pure tables. Therefore, they are currently not indexed propertly by DBpedia. The DBpedia extraction framework allows different extractors to be pluged-in. Therefore, this could be solved by writing a special extractor for bio and chemistry data. There were some people on the dbpedia list a while ago who wanted to do this, but we did not get any results from them yet. Georgi: Do you know anything about their progress? This highly makes sense and would be really cool. I saw on the SPIRE page, that you are allready providing a SPARQL endpoint over the data. Do you also serve that data as Linked Data with dereferencable URIs? If not yet, you can just throw Pubby ( order to get the dereferencing into place. The next step would be to generate RDF links between your URIs and DBpedia URIs. As we do not have a clue about animal taxa, I guess it would be best, if you generate these links and send them to us, so that we can load them into the DBpedia RDF store. Some more information about how to generate links is found here: I love both ideas. More interlinked dataset are great and you should also announce them on the LOD mailing list and put them into the LOD dataset list once they are published as Linked Data ( Now that we have lots of relevant data sets interlinked on the Semantic Web, I think search engines a really important for showing people what can be done with the data. Therefore, I think it would be really cool if the LOD data gets loaded into Swoogle and I hope that other search engines like SWSE and Zitgist do the same shortly. Keep on the great work on Swoogle.

Kingsley uHi all, Well, experience and logic tell us that one shouldn't crawl X number of million of documents if a dump is available. We got 2.x million livejournal in about 3 months (really dependant on livejournal's connection quality). We started to crawl geonames (6.4 million documents) and we planned, at that time, that it would have taken months to crawl everything. Also, this caused issues on Marc's servers. This said, everybody should download and index the rdf dump if it is available (a matter of a couple of hours). Then, if the system send newly created and/or updated documents to pingthesemanticweb.com, then consumers of that data will be able to periodically synch with the system, via ptsw. In any case, I won't suggest to spend everybody's bandwidth and time by dereferencing all URIs to get data available in a single downloadable file. Take care, Fred uHi all, Well, this seems good, but could I suggest to check log first? Google results are pure statistics. The logs of the server would confirm.

The latter is the correct usage of foaf:homepage; it doesn't relate a person to a xmlschema-datatyped literal, but to a document. This is so that it can have other independent properties and relationships. I found this by chance. On closer inspection, it seems to be a difference between the data generated by latest version of extractors (I downloaded and ran it last night (until my disk filled up:)), and the current dbpedia: when I look at the latest downloadables they are ok too: grep Gaiman homepages_en.nq . I haven't looked at the handling of other FOAF properties, nor of your own vocab, so I have no idea if this change is part of a bigger situation. For foaf:homepage it would be great if you could revert to the document-valued treatement of the property. cheers, Dan ps. I'm trying to grap *all* the links from wikipedia to twitter; is the external_links dump going to cover that, or they only include urls from the explicit 'external links' section of the page? running \"grep -v External external_links_en.nq\" I find some lines that don't trace directly to an External Links section. When I check them they're sometimes subsections of External Links, but not always. This seems good news for me. pps.

A lot of tables are used to store data of electoral, sports, competition results [3]. I started the extraction focusing on electoral results, firstly regarding USA presidential elections and therefore in general (it chapter). I had hard times finding the right solution due to a unfortunate solution I initially projected (involving JSONpedia). Please refer to progress page [1] to have more info about that. The final solution manages html pageâs representations instead of json ones and it consists in a Python package, which works well on different tableâs structure. It works on every wiki chapter, but data extraction strictly depend on rules created on a topic/language base. In fact tables are completely different in data and structures depending on the wiki chapter. Compare [4](it chapter) [5](en chapter) and [6](de chapter). Good results have been achieved on Electoral topic (it chapter). Hope to have the feedback from the whole community. Pills: USA elections results (it wiki pages): 1,8 % tableâs lost due to structureâs problems. 87,3 % cells correctly extracted and correctly mapped. 1,9 % cells lost due to a lack of mapping rules.

"A quick analysis of the classes in the DBpedia ontology"	"uI did a quick analysis of the classes in the DBpedia ontology and found quite a few issues that I think need attention. - Many classes have no instances. Each of these empty classes should be examined to see whether they should be removed or modified. - The sports-related groupings are differentially populated, differentially organized, and unaxiomatized. These groupings should be regularized and minimal axiomatizations provided for them. For example, there would be classes for Basketball under at least SportsLeague, SportsTeam, Coach, and SportsEvent each defined as the restriction of the grouping elements related to Basketball. The sports groupings include Sport (which is special), SportsLeague, SportsTeam, Athlete, Coach, SportsTeamMember, SportsManager, SportsEvent, SportFacility, SportCompetitionResult, SportsSeason, and Tournament. - Numerous stated inclusion relationships are not correct when considering the normal definition of the class names. Each of these should be examined and either descriptions of the classes that support the inclusion relationship be provided or the relationship itself modified. For example, instances of the RecordOffice class do not appear to be non-profit organizations. Some other examples of questionable or outright incorrect subclasses here are TermOfOffice, BackScene, ChessPlayer, PokerPlayer, TeamMember, Saint, FictionalCharacter, MythologicalFigure, OrganisationMember, Religious, Baronet, Medician, Professor, Embryology, Lymph, Constellation, Galaxy, ElectionDiagram, Olympics, OlympicEvent, ControlledDesignationOfOriginWine, PublicServiceInput, PublicServiceOutput, and ProgrammingLanguage. - Some class relationships are missing. For example, TeamMember is unrelated to SportsTeamMember even though they are both supposed to be members of athletic teams. Some other examples of missing relationships are between BullFighter and Bullfighter, between Host and TelevisionHost, and between Comic and Comics. The missing relationships should be provided or the classes merged. - Place is a rather unnatural union. It should either be removed or better organized. - There are quite a few subclasses of Building that are not truely buildings, including AmusementParkAttraction, Casino, Factory, Hotel, MilitaryStructure, Abbey and the other religious places of worship, Restaurant, ShoppingMall, and Venue. Similarly, there are a number of subclasses of ArchitecturalStructure that may not be architectural structures, including Garden, PublicTransitSystem, and Park. There are a few subclasses of NaturalPlace that are not necessarily natural places, including Canal, and even Lake. These classes should be moved up in the ontology. - The subclasses of Species are not collections of species. The subclasses should either be modified or moved elsewhere in the ontology. - The normal definition of PopulatedPlace is much too narrow to encompass all its subclasses. A new general class should be created to encompass the subclasses and PopulatedPlace be modified as necessary. - There are a number of strange top-level or second-level classes. These classes should be examined to ensure that they make sense. Many of these classes appear to be somehow related to measurements, including Altitude, Area, Blazon, ChartsPlacement, Demographics, Depth, GrossDomesticProduct, GrossDomesticProductPerCapita, HumanDevelopmentIndex, Population, Sales, Statistics, and Tax. Other strange classes include LifeCycleEvent, Imdb, Listen, PenaltyShootOut, PersonFunction, PoliticalFunction, Profession, TopicalConcept, Type, and YearInSpaceflight. Even if I had editing rights to the ontology I think that the fixes I have outlined above go beyond what should be done without some discussion. Comments? peter uHi Peter, Thank you for your detailed report. The DBpedia ontology is (a) crowdsourced and (b) follows a data-driven approach.

The DBpedia ontology looks much more like a unreviewed crowdsourced artifact than an artifact that matches either the information in Wikipedia or in DBpedia. Well, there are no formal inconsistencies in the DBpedia ontology, as it is too inexpressive to have inconsistencies. All that can be done is pointing out where the ontology does not appear to match either the normal definitions of the categories or the definitions found by examining Wikipedia information and differences between different parts of the ontology. I do have a list of all the empty classes, but this information is available elsewhere. The analysis that I sent out yesterday lists quite a number of deficiencies in the ontology. This analysis should be good enough to serve as a start on fixing the ontology. I agree that this would be a good idea. However, this should be an iterative process, and should not depend on a complete analysis. Well, producing a new ontology is work, and it would be nice that this work has an effect.

The major example is that there is no systematic checking of the relation between domain/ranges and the way properties are actually used (although the situation has improved in 3.9). An organization of classes should be based firstly on how properties are used, after all we are talking primarily linked data, not taxonomies. Some research has been done on this, and I will contribute some literature to the community if any activity starts on reconciling crowd-sourcing, automatic extraction of data, and good practices of ontology design.

Remember, DBpedia deploys Linked Data using a Quad Store, so the re-write rules and SPARQL queries used to perform the name->address indirection are extremely flexible. For instance, you can actually set the named graph URI scope for these SPARQL queries explicitly or via our NOT FROM NAMED GRAPH extension re., negation etc You can have a list of Named Graphs or excluded Named Graphs when generating the description of a DBpedia Entity URI's referent.

Examples include the asteroids, moons, planets and the stars. Astronomical objects are gravitationally bound structures that are associated with a position in space, but may consist of multiple independent astronomical bodies or objects. These objects range from single planets to star clusters, nebulae or entire galaxies. From this, a galaxy is not a celestial body, but it is a celestial object. A constellation is neither a celestial body nor a celestial object. Unfortunately, this is not a very the use of this phrase appears to vary somewhat, and the Wikipedia page does not point to a source for the definition. Some usages appear to allow constellations to be celestial bodies. My suggestion is that CelestialBody be renamed CelestialObject and that constellation be moved outside of it. Place and its subclasses: From Settlement, locality or populated place are general terms used in statistics, archaeology, geography, landscape history and other subjects for a permanent or temporary community in which people live or have lived, without being specific as to size, population or importance. A settlement can therefore range in size from a small number of dwellings grouped together to the largest of cities with surrounding urbanized areas. The term may include hamlets, villages, towns and cities. The term is used internationally in the field of geospatial modeling, and in that context is defined as \"a city, town, village, or other agglomeration of buildings where people live and work\".[1] From this, just about all subclasses of PopulatedPlace are not populated places. The only exception is settlement. From A building is a man-made structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place. Buildings come in a variety of shapes, sizes and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, to land prices, ground conditions, specific uses and aesthetic reasons. To better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures. Most subclasses of Building are not either not buildings, e.g., WindMotor and Treadmill, or are not always buildings, e.g., ShoppingMall. Many subclasses of Place also conflate function with structure, e.g, Church. The physical presence of many churches are not buildings, and some churches do not even have a physical structure associated with them at all. My suggestion is that this entire portion of the ontology needs to be revamped. Suggested changes include moving most of the subclasess out from under PopulatedPlace and making PopulatedPlace equivalent to Settlement, moving many of the subclasses out from under Building, and changing the names of many of the subclasses to better reflect their intended meaning. uOn 4/13/14 8:32 PM, Patel-Schneider, Peter wrote: You can use SPARQL 1.1 (from your SPARQL 1.1 compliant application) to generate triples is a named graph local to your application, based solutions returned to you from the public SPARQL endpoint.

Yes, why is contributing tweaks to the DBpedia ontology using an RDF document produced by you not an option here? Do that, and everything else falls into place.

The German chapter is working on ways to automatically import axioms in the mappings wiki, so of course this is an option too. I think you already pointed out most of your suggested changes so we can start working on these.

We could then better experiment and introduce the changes directly into the mappings wiki. Changing the ontology in the triplestore would create a synchronization problem, by the next extraction those changes would need to be recomputed and reintroduced.

"literatur extraction"	"uDear dbpedia team, I have a question concerning the extraction of literatur information from wikipedia pages. How can I get an integrated view of the information concerning the data inside the literature template. For example - the article includes a {{Literatur | Autor=Martin Ester, Jörg Sander | Titel=Knowledge Discovery in Databases. Techniken und Anwendungen | Verlag=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | Ort=Berlin | Jahr=2000 | ISBN=3-540-67328-8}} After your extraction and mapping processes each data element is separated from each other. As far a I can see, there is no chance to reconstruct the literatur information each other (just literals). thanks a lot in advance, Robert uOn Fri, Jan 4, 2013 at 6:54 AM, Robert Glaß < > wrote: I don't know the answer, but there are more problems than just the fact that the property values aren't grouped together. The ISBNs are being corrupted because they're extracted as integers instead of strings and the author property is all author names together rather than individual values for each author. Tom uDear Robert, Tom, The default behaviour for template extraction is to attach the template properties to the main resource while what you are looking for is actually a \"blank node\" with the template properties attached to the main resource. It is not currently supported by the framework but can be implemented easily with a custom extractor. This could be a nice to have feature but is not in our immediate priorities. However, we could help you / give you directions if you want to implement it. (the tricky part would be to process the data to locate duplicates) @Tom As for the integer problem, this is a common behaviour for the infobox extractor where type is inferred with heuristics. Custom extractors and the mappings extractor do not have this problem.

In my opinion it would be interesting to develop such an idea.

That is possibly the hardest part. Should NLP be used? Maybe this could become a GSoC project. Do you have any approach to propose?

The one thing that could help public endpoints would be operating as distributed main-memory databases, but for the economics of that to work out you need very high query volume. It comes down to the \"proof\" and \"trust\" parts of the Linked Data stack. Even if we don't have fully automated answers for these, the fact is that different linked data sources operate in different p.o.v.'s and that to maintain a system p.o.v. you need to decide what you \"trust\" to what extent. If there's a particular piece of the Linked Data web that's well behaved and well understood you can build a simple app that exploits it. In general the Linked Data web is a wild and wooly place and you need to do some data cleanup before you can write queries. So you need a system like Sindice which builds a knowledge base (in their case 50*10^9 triples) from a crawl. I see Linked Data as being more like a conversation between humans than a conversation between neurons. An agent working in this space needs to have some ability to ground terms, which means having either a 10^8+ triple 'generic database' or a beyond-state-of-the-art upper ontology of some kind. Of course. There's a lot of room for specialized techniques. Not long ago I'd figured out a really interesting calculation that could be expressed in SPARQL. Now, running this SPARQL query for all of the terms in our knowledge base would have taken 100 years but I had just 2 weeks to deliver a product. With more hardware and a different triple store, maybe I could have done it in 10 years or 5 years (and I would have blown the schedule simply negotiating for the software license with my boss and the vendor) Instead I developed a specialized algorithm that did the calculation in 24 hours. To go back to Sindice, they developed a framework for building a full-text index out of RDF data while bypassing the triple store. It's fast and very scalable. I've played up the option of loading :BaseKB into a triple store because it really is straightforward, flexible and a lot of fun. However, you can do really amazing things with this kind of RDF dump without the triple store, even on a 32-bit machine."
